[ "preparing data for archiving how do i prepare my dataset for secondary research? data should be prepared in such way to enable data to be used by other researchers, and for data archive to be able to create accurate catalogue records. researchers are encouraged to document data appropriately, (see our guidance on data documentation and metadata), to include research procedures and fieldwork methods and to ensure that data are held in organised manner. documentation is invaluable in enabling secondary users to contextualise data and conduct better informed re-use of material. any consent and confidentiality concerns which may inhibit archiving data should be resolved. see our guidance on consent and confidentiality. what are costs of preparing data and documentation for archiving? there should be no additional costs for archiving data, other than researcher(s) time to prepare data and documentation for deposit. this time should be costed into application. on average it is recommended that two to three weeks are costed into average two year research grant application to prepare and collate materials for deposit. however, owing to disparate nature of research and data creation, we cannot provide advice on exact costs likely to be incurred in data preparation. various activities typically associated with preparing data are outlined below, for which you can work out appropriate costs in terms of people's time and equipment/software needed. much data preparation can be carried out as part of research process during data entry and transcription, therefore significantly reducing cost of preparing data for archiving. for quantitative/numerical data, allow time to add appropriate variable, value and code labelling to data, to create spss set up files (if relevant), to supply syntax or logical statements for derived variables etc. as part of data-level documentation. for qualitative data, provision should be made for full transcription of interviews, focus groups discussions and so on, where budget will allow. transcription cost should be included in overall research budget. if full transcription is really not feasible, interviews or focus groups should be fully summarised. for transcript in non-english languages, english summaries should be prepared for archiving, so costs for translation might be appropriate. data listing giving details of each interview should be created. consent and data confidentiality also impact on costs for archiving. consent for data archiving should be arranged during research when consent for participation and data use is obtained, or arranged afterwards. allow time to anonymise data, where required. ideally anonymisation should be undertaken during project but will need to be checked before archiving data. time involved should not be underestimated as anonymisation appropriate for archiving may require use of pseudonyms, or preparation of anonymisation key. anonymised document should be meaningful and usable by other researchers. see anonymising research data guidelines and techniques for detailed guidance. cost of digitisation of non-digital sources, e.g. if research involves work on paper-based collection, can usually be included in overall research budget. additional suggestions and requirements on preparing data and documentation for archiving can be found in 'create and manage' pages. how can other researchers understand and therefore use my data? data can only be understood and used to their full potential by other researchers if they are adequately documented, see documenting your data. any potential re-user should understand exactly how research was carried out and what data mean. data creator should provide sufficient information on objectives and methodology of research; explain data collection methods used; explicitly describe meanings of variables and codes used and any derivation, transformations or data cleaning carried out. must i transcribe interviews if i want to archive them? it is recommended that transcriptions of interviews are made. full transcriptions significantly extend potential for analysis and re-use of research collection, both by original researchers and by secondary users. transcription should be seen as step within analytical process of research, rather than as mechanical conversion of data. if interviews are not transcribed, then recorded interviews could be archived alongside summaries. see guidance on transcription. how do i transcribe interviews? audio-visually recorded interviews are usually transcribed manually, see guidance on transcription. standard transcription structure is recommended if transcripts are to be archived or if computer assisted qualitative data analysis (caqdas) software is to be used to analyse data. transcriptions possess unique identifier, adopt uniform layout, make use of speaker tags clearly indicating question/answer sequence, carry line breaks, be page numbered and carry document header giving brief details of interview: date, place, interviewer name, interviewee details, etc. who do i contact if i need further advice on preparing data for archiving? if after reviewing information on preparing and documenting data for sharing and archiving, any query or question remains unresolved, get in touch with producer relations team through uk data service."]

[ 'data management is not just responsibility of researcher who has created or collected data. various parties are involved in research process and may play role in ensuring good quality data, safeguarding them and facilitating data sharing. it is crucial that roles and responsibilities are assigned and not just presumed. for collaborative research, assigning roles and responsibilities across partners is important. people involved in data management and sharing can include: project director designing and overseeing research research staff designing research, collecting, processing and analysing data laboratory or technical staff generating metadata and documentation database designer external contractors involved in data collection, data entry, transcribing, processing or analysis support staff managing and administering research and research funding, providing ethical review and assessing intellectual property rights institutional it services staff providing data storage, security and backup services external data centres or web archives that facilitate data sharing you should also consider whether any particular training may be needed for any staff involved. your institution or specialist organisations may coordinate or provide training in various aspects of research data management. research centres and large-scale projects can also consider how best to support researchers through framework of shared best practices, guidance and policies.']

[ 'CONSENT AND ETHICS\r\nCan a participant give consent for data archiving when the data contain sensitive information about other individuals?\r\nIt is likely that a participant may have no appreciation of the Data Protection Act, duty of confidentiality or privacy laws, in other words, what information should and should not be shared. However, a participant giving consent for the data they have provided to be shared should be able to make his/her own judgement. If, as a researcher, you are uncertain as to whether your data contain any possibly damaging or incriminating information, we would recommend that you remove or alter those sections before data are shared (ensuring any removal is indicated in the data). We can advise on this on a case-by-case basis. Get in touch with the Producer Relations team through the UK Data Service.\r\n\r\nAt what stage in the research process should I seek consent for data sharing?\r\nThere are a number of options dependant on the type of research being conducted. Consent should ideally be sought whilst conducting the research e.g. at the time of an interview or survey. However, at times it may be more logical to obtain consent for data sharing at a later stage, when the participants have a better understanding of the data in question. It is also possible to return to participants to seek consent for data uses (such as data sharing) possibly not discussed at the time of fieldwork. See also gaining consent for information on one-off or process consent.\r\n\r\nDo I need consent for data sharing for textual and audio-visual material separately?\r\nNot unless the data will be re-used and shared for different purposes e.g. if only transcripts will be archived and audio recordings not. In that case consent for data sharing is needed for transcripts, but not for audio. However, it is recommended for researchers to obtain consent that applies equally to all the materials resulting from the research.\r\n\r\nIf data need to be anonymised, there may be a problem for sharing audio-visual data, as they are not easily anonymised and the damage to data integrity may be higher. In such cases separate consent for data sharing may need to be sought for textual and audio-visual data, whereby anonymised textual data can be shared whilst non-anonymised audio-visual may be preserved differently. See information on consent for using or sharing audio-visual material.\r\n\r\nIf research is carried out in a public environment and data are obtained from multiple people (e.g. video footage, sound recordings), how do I obtain consent?\r\nAt a minimum, the law requires notification of the recording through clear signage. For example, a researcher video recording interaction and conversation in a shopping centre could not brief everyone in that location face to face. It would be more appropriate to have information sheets/signs about the project and the recording displayed in the location.\r\n\r\nDo I need to gain parental consent when doing research amongst children?\r\nBased on a legal ruling, young people aged 16 years and above can give their own consent. For younger children, a judgement must be made about their ability to understand what is being asked of them. They should have clear and intelligible information about the project, suited to their level of understanding. They should be asked for their individual, voluntary consent, in addition to that of a parent/guardian and/or head teacher. See detailed information on gaining consent in research with children.\r\n\r\nMy research takes place in a developing country. How do I explain data archiving and secondary use of data to participants?\r\nExplain in a way that is appropriate to the cultural environment that the information they give you may be used by other like-minded researchers. If you have made certain agreements, e.g. that data will not be seen by government officials or the press, make it clear these promises will still apply to archived data.\r\n\r\nDoes the UK Data Archive ensure that ethical guidelines were followed by researchers for the collection of data that are archived by the Archive?\r\nThe UK Data Archive assesses data that are offered for archiving for potential confidential, sensitive or personal information.  We also seek information on whether or not researchers have obtained consent for data sharing. Where we have concerns, we discuss with depositors options such as further anonymisation of data or renegotiating consent - where this is not possible, data may be rejected from the collection.  In this way, we ensure the ethical re-use of its archived data. Note, however, that the Archive is not an ethics review committee - it focuses only on the ethics of data sharing. In addition, we advise researchers on issues of informed consent, anonymisation and research ethics and encourages researchers to adhere to appropriate ethical guidelines when collecting data.\r\n\r\nAre there special considerations for gaining consent for data sharing from children or vulnerable or elderly populations?\r\nYes, special considerations are needed for gaining consent for data sharing because of the nature of the sample group, similarly to obtaining consent for research participation from these populations, see Special cases of consent.\r\n']

[ "informing participants as part of informed consent procedures, it is important to tell participants about purpose and benefits of sharing and archiving research data and making them available for future research, so participant can take informed decision. following information can be used to explain this, with appropriate modifications for your research. what is data archive? data archive is secure place where different types of materials are stored and looked after indefinitely. most traditional archives deal with paper records, such as local history archive. in digital age many archives now hold electronic records. these demand different methods and skills to curate materials to ensure that they can be used well into future. uk data archive houses several thousand datasets of interest to researchers, teachers and students who work in social sciences or humanities, and makes this material available for use in research and learning. why put data in archive?for many participants of research study, taking part is way of getting their voices heard and of being listened to. sharing their lives and stories in in-depth interview is way for them to have say about topics that are important to them. some people are happy to have their own names attributed to material they provide, while others prefer not to. either way, providing 'voice' is essential job for archive. second reason to put materials in archive is that it is impossible for researchers to learn everything they want to from data they collect at time of their project. because so many things can be learned from data, preserving them means they can be shared with other researchers who will find data useful now and for many years to come. another important reason to archive data is that some of data have been provided by very hard-to-reach groups, politicians, sick, very elderly, socially excluded or those who otherwise are not usually included in research projects. it is often very difficult and expensive to recruit such participants for research and, once they have contributed, it is important to make full use of information they have given. lastly, archives are very good places to keep data safe and secure, providing lasting evidence of published research findings. archivists are experts in backing up data, protecting them from viruses and more. they also specialise in looking after data to make sure they can still be used many years in future when technology will be very different from today. how do i know my data will be used ethically?putting data into archive is not same as making them available on web. archivists value materials deposited with them and take their duty very seriously to make sure materials are used only in appropriate ways. their primary concern is to protect research participants. to that end, there are three strategies for protecting data. first is to gain informed consent from participants to share data; second is to anonymise data; and third is to control access to data, via licensing. in almost every archive, some data will be available to public, some will be covered by standard licence, some need special permission, and some data are made unavailable for lengthy period. what does anonymising mean?this means removing anything that could identify participant or anyone talked about in data. good examples are names of people and places. in archives, personal contact details are never made available. examples would include things such as addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses. here is example of anonymising some real names: original textanonymised text schools e.g. st john's primary schoollocal secondary school or chosen made up name businesses e.g. mcdonald'sfast food outlet/restaurant or chosen made up name family and friends' names e.g. auntie bettychanged to aunt or pseudonym how might data be used?data can be used in many ways. for example, one well-known collection known as edwardians, which interviewed 450 older people born before 1918, has been used to study topics as different as men's roles in family meal preparation, and how young civilian soldiers survived trench warfare on western front by drawing on emotional and practical support of their families. archived data may also be used by researchers, to compare with their own materials; by teachers, for use in their courses; and by journalists and policymakers. others may be interested in how research was done, e.g. how questions were asked. of course, it is almost impossible to predict all ways that data might be used. past examples have shown that users are very creative in looking at data in very new and innovative ways. who owns data and what is copyright?if you are asked to sign copyright statement this means that person asking will have legal right to use your contributions on agreed terms. for example, they can publish article on research which may quote some of your words. researcher can further sign licence with archive that allows archive to legally distribute material to bona fide researchers, under conditions agreed by researcher. how do archives store my data safely?in many archives, data are stored in conditions that meet national and international standards - temperature, security and so on. they will have licences and access controls to ensure that only authorised and registered users can get hold of data. because sharing your data can be done safely and because there are so many benefits, we hope you will agree to archive your data."]

[ "research without consent there are circumstances where no form of consent can be obtained. these situations are exceptional and will need case-by-case review and clear arguments to satisfy requirements of ethics review boards. there can be varied reasons why consent is not possible. limited capacity may prevent person from being fully informed. data may have already been collected for another purpose that did not require consent, such as government administrative data. consent may not be technically feasible in some very large scale projects. data may have been collected years ago when formal consent procedures were not standard practice. finally, if knowledge of research would invalidate method, then it may not be possible to inform participants in advance. because principle of consent is so important, proceeding without it is possible, but will be subject to rigorous ethics review. in general, such research will have to meet three conditions: clear value and benefit from doing researchno alternative research design can achieve same result, that is, deception or lack of consent is essentialthere is no or very minimal risk of harm to participants. it is also possible to share data without explicit consent, but special consideration must be given to each situation. relevant factors include: is there any language in consent form or information sheet (if any were used) that explicitly precludes data sharing, such as data will be used only for this project? in such cases, sharing is not possible. how disclosive is material? are people or organisations named or can their identities be inferred?is it personal or sensitive data under current data protection laws? if people are no longer living, then data is not defined as personal. is anything known about participants' attitudes about having their data shared? for example, in older oral histories, consent was rarely sought, but assumption of this genre is usually to share peoples' life stories. what harm, and to whom, could result from any disclosure? what about to any identifiable third parties?can data be de-identified?could data be re-submitted for ethical review? for example, historically valuable data held at london school for hygiene and tropical medicine on people with hiv is being prepared for archiving without explicit consent. data are being thoroughly anonymised, researchers have assessed risk in consultation with uk data service, and ethics committee has reviewed and agreed to sharing under controlled conditions. uk data service advises that data sharing without explicit consent can be permissible on case-by-case basis if factors above are given proper consideration. in such cases, we communicate with depositors to ensure that they clearly understand their and our responsibilities for deposited data."]

[ 'data management and sharing activities need to be costed into research, in terms of time and resources needed. by planning early, costs can be significantly reduced. there are two approaches to costing research data management and sharing in advance of research project starting. either can be used in data management plan or can inform funding application. approach 1: all data-related activities and resources for entire data lifecycle - from data creation, through processing, analyses and storage, to sharing and long-term preservation - can be priced to calculate total cost of all data generation, data sharing, data access and preservation activities. approach 2: only resources that would be needed to preserve and make research data shareable beyond primary research team are identified. these resources may include: people, equipment, infrastructure and tools to manage, document, organise, store and provide access to data. data management costing tool there is no hard and fast rule for costing research data management, as some projects will afford more attention to detailed data documentation, organisation and formatting than others as part of routine fieldwork or data preparation before analysis. however, uk data service has developed simple activity-based costing tool that can be used for approach 2 of costing data management in social sciences. how costing tool was developed data management costing tool was developed with researchers as part of jisc data management planning for esrc research data-rich investments project, through data management interviews with researchers in esrc centres and programmes. researchers were asked to estimate time or cost needed for activities related to data collection, data entry and transcription, data validation and documentation and cost of preparing data for archiving and re-use. overall, researchers found it hard to cost data management activities, as many activities are integral part of standard research activities and data analysis. identified high cost activities were transcribing and anonymising qualitative data and cleaning and verifying quantitative data. information from researchers was then combined with our expertise in measures needed to make research data shareable and reusable. key is that when preparing data for sharing is left until end of project, cost is often too high due to competition with publishing and seeking future project funding.']

[ "preparing data for archiving how do i prepare my dataset for secondary research? data should be prepared in such way to enable data to be used by other researchers, and for data archive to be able to create accurate catalogue records. researchers are encouraged to document data appropriately, (see our guidance on data documentation and metadata), to include research procedures and fieldwork methods and to ensure that data are held in organised manner. documentation is invaluable in enabling secondary users to contextualise data and conduct better informed re-use of material. any consent and confidentiality concerns which may inhibit archiving data should be resolved. see our guidance on consent and confidentiality. what are costs of preparing data and documentation for archiving? there should be no additional costs for archiving data, other than researcher(s) time to prepare data and documentation for deposit. this time should be costed into application. on average it is recommended that two to three weeks are costed into average two year research grant application to prepare and collate materials for deposit. however, owing to disparate nature of research and data creation, we cannot provide advice on exact costs likely to be incurred in data preparation. various activities typically associated with preparing data are outlined below, for which you can work out appropriate costs in terms of people's time and equipment/software needed. much data preparation can be carried out as part of research process during data entry and transcription, therefore significantly reducing cost of preparing data for archiving. for quantitative/numerical data, allow time to add appropriate variable, value and code labelling to data, to create spss set up files (if relevant), to supply syntax or logical statements for derived variables etc. as part of data-level documentation. for qualitative data, provision should be made for full transcription of interviews, focus groups discussions and so on, where budget will allow. transcription cost should be included in overall research budget. if full transcription is really not feasible, interviews or focus groups should be fully summarised. for transcript in non-english languages, english summaries should be prepared for archiving, so costs for translation might be appropriate. data listing giving details of each interview should be created. consent and data confidentiality also impact on costs for archiving. consent for data archiving should be arranged during research when consent for participation and data use is obtained, or arranged afterwards. allow time to anonymise data, where required. ideally anonymisation should be undertaken during project but will need to be checked before archiving data. time involved should not be underestimated as anonymisation appropriate for archiving may require use of pseudonyms, or preparation of anonymisation key. anonymised document should be meaningful and usable by other researchers. see anonymising research data guidelines and techniques for detailed guidance. cost of digitisation of non-digital sources, e.g. if research involves work on paper-based collection, can usually be included in overall research budget. additional suggestions and requirements on preparing data and documentation for archiving can be found in 'create and manage' pages. how can other researchers understand and therefore use my data? data can only be understood and used to their full potential by other researchers if they are adequately documented, see documenting your data. any potential re-user should understand exactly how research was carried out and what data mean. data creator should provide sufficient information on objectives and methodology of research; explain data collection methods used; explicitly describe meanings of variables and codes used and any derivation, transformations or data cleaning carried out. must i transcribe interviews if i want to archive them? it is recommended that transcriptions of interviews are made. full transcriptions significantly extend potential for analysis and re-use of research collection, both by original researchers and by secondary users. transcription should be seen as step within analytical process of research, rather than as mechanical conversion of data. if interviews are not transcribed, then recorded interviews could be archived alongside summaries. see guidance on transcription. how do i transcribe interviews? audio-visually recorded interviews are usually transcribed manually, see guidance on transcription. standard transcription structure is recommended if transcripts are to be archived or if computer assisted qualitative data analysis (caqdas) software is to be used to analyse data. transcriptions possess unique identifier, adopt uniform layout, make use of speaker tags clearly indicating question/answer sequence, carry line breaks, be page numbered and carry document header giving brief details of interview: date, place, interviewer name, interviewee details, etc. who do i contact if i need further advice on preparing data for archiving?

uk data archive is curator of largest collection of digital data in social sciences and humanities in united kingdom. with several thousand datasets relating to society, both historical and contemporary, our archive is vital resource for researchers, teachers and learners. we acquire high quality data from academic, public, and commercial sectors, providing continuous access to these data while we also support existing and emerging and communities of data users. we are acknowledged centre of expertise in areas of acquiring, curating and providing access to data. since 2005 our archive has been designated place of deposit by national archives allowing us to curate public records. we direct and manage uk data service which is uk's flagship portal for research resources, where we host key national and international survey data, databanks, census data and and qualitative data. more recently we have been providing secure access to disclosive and more sensitive data. we have been engaged in number of data management initiatives supported by esrc and jisc including running rural economy and land use programme (relu) data support service which focused on providing access to key environmental data. we also provide curation of data for other organisations at cost. we are proud to be actively engaged in research and development, and throughout our 40+ year history, we have remained at cutting edge to become international leader in curating and sharing data. where do your data come from? data collections are deposited from variety of sources, including academic researchers, government departments, intergovernmental organisations, independent research institutes, and market research organisations. academic research funded by economic and social research council (esrc) is important source of data, as council operates mandatory datasets policy whereby all award holders are expected to offer data to uk data archive for archiving. examples of large-scale esrc datasets are british social attitudes survey (bsas), british election studies (bes) and british household panel study (bhps). censuses and large surveys carried out by governments for their own policy purposes are particularly rich sources of data for further exploration. central government, and in particular, office for national statistics (ons) is major and regular supplier of data series, including general household survey (ghs), labour force survey (lfs), and health survey for england (hse). some data collections may not have been collected specifically for research purposes. administrative databases, such as national health service patient re-registrations, although collected for very different purpose, can provide valuable and timely information for researchers. what is uk data service? uk data service provides unified point of access to extensive range of high quality social and economic data, including census data, government funded surveys, longitudinal studies, international macrodata, qualitative data and business microdata. it is designed to provide seamless access and support to meet current and future research demands of both academic and non-academic users, and to help them maximise impact of their work. uk data service is new service which replaces earlier esrc investments of economic and social data service (esds), secure data service (sds), survey question bank and elements of esrc census programme. it also incorporates outputs from cross-council relu data support service (relu-dss). what happened to relu data support service?

data can only be understood and used to their full potential by other researchers if they are adequately documented, see documenting your data. any potential re-user should understand exactly how research was carried out and what data mean. data creator should provide sufficient information on objectives and methodology of research; explain data collection methods used; explicitly describe meanings of variables and codes used and any derivation, transformations or data cleaning carried out. must i transcribe interviews if i want to archive them? it is recommended that transcriptions of interviews are made. full transcriptions significantly extend potential for analysis and re-use of research collection, both by original researchers and by secondary users. transcription should be seen as step within analytical process of research, rather than as mechanical conversion of data. if interviews are not transcribed, then recorded interviews could be archived alongside summaries. see guidance on transcription. how do i transcribe interviews? audio-visually recorded interviews are usually transcribed manually, see guidance on transcription. standard transcription structure is recommended if transcripts are to be archived or if computer assisted qualitative data analysis (caqdas) software is to be used to analyse data. transcriptions possess unique identifier, adopt uniform layout, make use of speaker tags clearly indicating question/answer sequence, carry line breaks, be page numbered and carry document header giving brief details of interview: date, place, interviewer name, interviewee details, etc. who do i contact if i need further advice on preparing data for archiving?

research data will be managed throughout research cycle and how best to prepare for data deposit with uk data service. most research data can be successfully archived and shared for future reuse. esrc expects grant holders to consider all issues related to confidentiality, ethics, security and copyright before initiating research. any challenges to data sharing (such as copyright or data confidentiality) should be critically considered in plan, with possible solutions discussed to optimise data sharing. data management plan includes following topics. 1. assessment of existing data explanation of existing data sources that will be used by research project, with references analysis of gaps identified between currently available and required data for research where research grant applicants plan to create new data as part of their esrc-funded proposal, they must demonstrate that no suitable data are available for re-use. esrc encourages re-use of existing data and therefore encourages applicants and grant holders to consider breadth of data available from various sources before committing to primary data collection. when using existing data sources, consider copyright and intellectual property rights (ipr) of those data and conditions of their use, to decide whether resulting derived data can be shared. data sources that can be consulted are: discover uk data service, with over 6,000 datasets of key economic, social and historical data spanning many disciplines and themes rcuk gateway to research of past and present research grants and their outputs 2. information on new data provide information on data that will be produced or accessed by research project: data volume data type data quality, formats, standards documentation and metadata methodologies for data collection and/or processing source and trustworthiness of third party data using standardised and interchangeable data formats ensures long-term usability of data. clear and detailed data descriptions and annotation, together with user-friendly accompanying documentation on methods and contextual information, makes dataeasy to understand and interpret and therefore

for quality assurance that will be carried out on data collected at time of data collection, data entry, digitisation and data checking should be described. for example this may include: documenting calibration of instruments taking duplicate samples or measurements standardised data capture, data entry or recording methods data entry validation techniques methods of transcription peer review of data guidance on data quality control 4. security and backup of data describe data security and backup procedures that you will adopt to ensure data and metadata are securely stored during lifetime of project. if your data is sensitive (e.g. detailed personal data) you should discuss appropriate security measures which you will be taking. you may need to discuss your institution's policy on backups. guidance on storing, backup and security guidance on version control 5. management and curation of data outline your plans for preparing, organising and documenting data. crucial part of

[ 'data management and sharing activities need to be costed into research, in terms of time and resources needed. by planning early, costs can be significantly reduced. there are two approaches to costing research data management and sharing in advance of research project starting. either can be used in data management plan or can inform funding application. approach 1: all data-related activities and resources for entire data lifecycle - from data creation, through processing, analyses and storage, to sharing and long-term preservation - can be priced to calculate total cost of all data generation, data sharing, data access and preservation activities. approach 2: only resources that would be needed to preserve and make research data shareable beyond primary research team are identified. these resources may include: people, equipment, infrastructure and tools to manage, document, organise, store and provide access to data. data management costing tool there is no hard and fast rule for costing research data management, as some projects will afford more attention to detailed data documentation, organisation and formatting than others as part of routine fieldwork or data preparation before analysis. however, uk data service has developed simple activity-based costing tool that can be used for approach 2 of costing data management in social sciences. how costing tool was developed data management costing tool was developed with researchers as part of jisc data management planning for esrc research data-rich investments project, through data management interviews with researchers in esrc centres and programmes. researchers were asked to estimate time or cost needed for activities related to data collection, data entry and transcription, data validation and documentation and cost of preparing data for archiving and re-use. overall, researchers found it hard to cost data management activities, as many activities are integral part of standard research activities and data analysis. identified high cost activities were transcribing and anonymising qualitative data and cleaning and verifying quantitative data. information from researchers was then combined with our expertise in measures needed to make research data shareable and reusable. key is that when preparing data for sharing is left until end of project, cost is often too high due to competition with publishing and seeking future project funding.']

[ "overview in order to make sure that research data can be made available for future reuse, it is important that consent for future reuse of data by other researchers is sought from participants. participants should be informed how research data will be stored, preserved and used in long-term, and how confidentiality can be protected when needed. language to avoidconsent forms should not preclude data sharing. so promises to destroy data or promises that data will only be seen or accessed by research team should be avoided. terms such as 'fully anonymous' or 'strictly confidential' should be avoided, as they are often impossible to define. better is to indicate how data will be anonymised (e.g. by removing all personal information that could directly identify individual) and that whilst data will be made available to other researchers, confidentiality will be protected. how to seek consent for data sharingconsent procedures must be tailored for specific research context, methods and sample, nature of data (personal, sensitive, level of detail), format of data (surveys, written, recordings) and planned data uses and handling. this will influence type of consent and consent process used. more detailed requirements and examples of these are offered in sections on gaining written or oral consent, and consent forms. it is important to note that researchers are not obliged to obtain consent. they are obliged to seek consent and to impartially advise participants about risks and benefits of research participation and data sharing. participants then decide what they will consent to."]

[ "consent in special cases there are situations where special considerations are needed when seeking consent. we highlight just few of them and explain some implications for data sharing. medical researchinternet researchtwitterconsent for linking to administrative datachildren and young adultspeople with learning difficultiesresearch within organisations or in workplacecrime medical researchwhere research involves medical matters, medical research ethics committees will need to be involved to approve methodology and consent forms. researcher should also be aware of standards traditionally asserted by such committees, and at times, committees can be skeptical about data. researchers will need to fully document procedures for safely handling data, especially personal data, when sharing. all applications to research nhs patients are done through standard application form used by all nhs research ethics committees across uk. for further information see: nhs national research ethics service application and supportmedical research council ethics and research guidance internet researchincreasingly, researchers gather data from online discussion groups, blogs, social media and websites. separation between public domain and private space may be blurred. question to ask is whether to seek consent to gather and use such materials from individual, moderator or webmaster. there are no absolute answers. permission from webmaster or copyright owner should be sought if text from (public) web page is used for research, mainly for copyright reasons. if information is taken from restricted environment where members contribute information that is therefore not considered to be in public domain (chat room, forum, discussion group), then good ethical practice is to inform and seek consent for research and sharing from each individual providing information and show that this has been obtained. for further information: mrs guidelines for online researchassociation of internet researchers ethics guidancebps ethics guidelines for internet-mediated research consent and twitterpublic tweets may appear similar to public space, but there are legal and morally significant factors to consider. firstly there are constraints from twitter's terms and conditions of use. tweets may not be anonymised and authors must honour requests for change or deletion. this can become problematic if paper based on quoted tweets has already been published or twitter data is shared.researchers have duty of care to tweeter, whether content has been made public, or not. for small scale data projects, consent can be sought by: contacting tweeter directly to request permission to use tweets in researchproviding full information via websitemaking it clear to tweeters they will not be anonymous. when consent is not possible there may be alternatives, and in selected cases, consent may not be necessary. for example, consent is not necessary where data is aggregated and no identification is possible, or where tweets are from public, official or institutional accounts. it should be noted that even if tweetid is not real name tweet text can be searched and re-linked with tweeter. we would like to acknowledge assistance from matthew williams and luke sloan at social data science lab in presenting this information about consent and twitter. more detail is available from social data science lab ethics statement. consent for linking to administrative dataunderstanding society is large-scale longitudinal household panel survey, in which participants are interviewed each year. each participant completes individual questionnaire, but they are also asked if they consent to survey team linking to range of administrative data records (such as their health, education, employment and pension records). both elements of survey have different consent procedures. for annual household and individual questionnaire, participants are sent advance letter shortly before interviewers contact them. this letter reminds them about purpose of survey and asks them to participate again. people joining survey are also given information leaflet which explains more about aims of study, what is entailed in joining study and emphasises voluntary nature of their participation. this voluntary participation is also re-emphasised at key points throughout interviews. no written consent is sought, rather it is implied through their participation in interview. for administrative data linkage, participants are given information leaflet during interview which explains important aspects of data linkage. leaflet contains information on what data study is interested in, who will use data, data security, what their consent covers and how long it lasts and how to withdraw their consent. participants are given time to read this leaflet, and then asked to read and sign consent form. you can view information leaflets and consent forms that were used in wave 4 of study. research with children and young adultsresearch participants must be provided with full information about research in order to give their informed consent to take part. careful thought needs to be given to translating this into practice when participant is child. clearest guidance on consent from children can be found in advice for clinical practice which presumes, based on legal ruling, that young people aged 16 years and above can give their own consent. for younger children, judgement must be made about their ability to understand what is being asked of them. information must be given in clear language at level that child can understand, using visual aids if necessary. in this way they can be asked for their individual voluntary consent, in addition to that of parent/guardian and/or head teacher. due to their legal status as minor and implied vulnerability that this status confers, researcher often has to negotiate access to children via gatekeepers (e.g. teachers or carers), who through their relationship with child are assumed to have protective role. gatekeepers will require information about research, how consent will be obtained from children and responsible adults and extent of confidentiality, prior to approving access to children. in other situations gatekeepers control physical access to children, such as in schools, where permission is needed to make initial contact with parents. again, in order to gain access to children, researchers may be asked to make changes to their data collection instruments or to require parents to take positive action, i.e. elect for their child to 'opt in' to research. confidentiality, anonymity, storage and sharing of data should be explained in way that children can understand. it should also be made clear who will have access to information and what will happen to it when research is complete. information can be given about how data will be used, in same clear language as used about research. it is recommended that written information should always be provided for child and responsible adult, including contact telephone number, should they wish to contact researchers. see example consent form for research with children. for further information see: informed consent, gatekeepers and go-betweens: negotiating consent in child- and youth-orientated institutions informed consent and research process: following rules or striking balances? guidelines for research with children and young people people with learning difficultiesresearch with people who have learning difficulties raises questions of ownership, power and exploitation which reflect ethical concerns of much general research but which can be more problematic and therefore need special consideration. revealing sensitive material in records, or stirring of painful memories of past during interviews also raises another ethical issue about need to provide support for those who are involved in this type of research. extra time needs to be built into project for these concerns. particular attention should be paid to discussion of purpose and implications of research and data sharing and to ensuring that these have been understood. use of any documentation or consent form needs to be appropriate, recognising adult status, but at same time being accessible. careful attention should be paid to use of language. cartoons or drawings run risk of being patronising, whereas appropriate photographs or diagrams combined with clear statements in large print and double spacing can create attractive and informative form to be referred to by participants. one way of enabling people to understand as clearly as possible implications of their named participation in research is to discuss with them who is likely to read published research, and who will have access to archived material. examples of such literature can be shown and discussed. books are significant and powerful examples of public realm even for those who cannot read. in cases where researcher finds it difficult to understand participant, it is important to find interpreter i.e. friend, relation, or long-term carer. research within organisations or in workplaceresearch with people within organisation or workplace will need additional consent if work is to be discussed. information given by employee in interview which takes place during course of employment (typically on work premises) should not be used unless employer has given consent. this is because employees may be seen to owe duty of confidentiality to their employer. indeed employment contracts may contain confidentiality clauses. it is always advisable when carrying out research with someone in workplace, in working hours, to discuss whether consent from employers is necessary. it is responsibility of researcher to be aware of policy of each organisation. see example consent form for use with interviews in workplace. crimeresearch into crime requires different form of consent. participants should be made aware that researcher may under some circumstances need to disclose information relating to criminal activity. normally, there is no legal obligation to disclose information relating to criminal activity - unless legal proceedings or investigation are underway. even then, confidants will only be guilty of perverting course of justice if they deliberately evade questioning. they are therefore unlikely to be under legal duty to disclose unless actually approached by police with regard to specific information or case in question. for further information see: british society of criminology code of ethics for researchers in field of criminology"]

[ "consent forms must i always use consent forms when gathering data from people? no, use of written consent forms in research is not mandatory. obtaining informed consent for people's participation in research and for use of data gathered for various research purposes is ethical requirement for most research and is typically required by research ethics committees. whether such consent is obtained verbally or in writing, using brief informative statement or detailed consent form, depends on nature of research, kind of data gathered and how data will be used. although obtaining consent in writing is recommended where possible, as it reduces uncertainty over what was agreed between researcher and participant, it may be too formal for some research with people. it is responsibility of researcher to address this problem. for non-sensitive data gathered during quantitative surveys (questionnaires) or informal interviews, where no personal data are gathered or where personal identifiers are removed from data, obtaining written consent may not be required. at minimum information sheet should be provided to participants detailing nature and scope of study, identity of researcher(s) and what will happen to data collected (including any data sharing or archiving if applicable). if, however, survey extends beyond asking questions to include activities such as nurse visit, taking samples, making physical measurements, etc. then written consent is usually required. if data are collected verbally through audio-recordings, verbal consent agreements can be audio-recorded together with data. if personal data, sensitive data or confidential data are gathered during research, use of written consent forms is recommended to assure compliance with data protection act, see data protection and sharing research data and with ethical requirements. for personal and/or sensitive data to be processed, archived and disseminated by archive, explicit consent is needed from each participant. ideally this should be in writing. further information is available on options of written or oral consent, on use of consent forms and on consent in surveys under consent pages. can you help me draft my consent form that will take into consideration sharing/archiving of research data? uk data archive producer relations team can comment on draft consent forms. detailed examples for various types of research that take into account data sharing are available, see consent forms. information specific to data archiving, that explains procedures, benefits and risks of archiving and sharing data, is available for researchers, see why share data and informing research participants. how and where should i store consent forms? if consent forms contain personal information on participants that could result in disclosure of participant's identity from data, then they should be stored separately from research data (according to data protection act). length of time that consent forms should be stored will be informed by institutional or research ethics committee requirements. blank sample consent form can be archived at uk data archive alongside research data as part of documentation providing background information to data. do i submit all participants' consent forms to uk data archive when i deposit data for archiving? no, since consent forms contain personal information, they are not archived at archive alongside research data. it is researcher's or research institution's responsibility to store consent forms safely and to decide how long they should be kept. blank consent form and information sheet can be archived at archive alongside research data as documentation providing background information on data. there are two reasons for asking research participants for copyright to be transferred to researcher. first, it gives researcher right to publish extracts based on words of participant (e.g. interview or diary extract) without needing to return to participant each time to obtain permission for publishing. second, it allows researcher to authorise third party such as archive to make copies of digital materials for purpose of digital preservation."]

[ "research without consent there are circumstances where no form of consent can be obtained. these situations are exceptional and will need case-by-case review and clear arguments to satisfy requirements of ethics review boards. there can be varied reasons why consent is not possible. limited capacity may prevent person from being fully informed. data may have already been collected for another purpose that did not require consent, such as government administrative data. consent may not be technically feasible in some very large scale projects. data may have been collected years ago when formal consent procedures were not standard practice. finally, if knowledge of research would invalidate method, then it may not be possible to inform participants in advance. because principle of consent is so important, proceeding without it is possible, but will be subject to rigorous ethics review. in general, such research will have to meet three conditions: clear value and benefit from doing researchno alternative research design can achieve same result, that is, deception or lack of consent is essentialthere is no or very minimal risk of harm to participants. it is also possible to share data without explicit consent, but special consideration must be given to each situation. relevant factors include: is there any language in consent form or information sheet (if any were used) that explicitly precludes data sharing, such as data will be used only for this project? in such cases, sharing is not possible. how disclosive is material? are people or organisations named or can their identities be inferred?is it personal or sensitive data under current data protection laws? if people are no longer living, then data is not defined as personal. is anything known about participants' attitudes about having their data shared? for example, in older oral histories, consent was rarely sought, but assumption of this genre is usually to share peoples' life stories. what harm, and to whom, could result from any disclosure? what about to any identifiable third parties?can data be de-identified?could data be re-submitted for ethical review? for example, historically valuable data held at london school for hygiene and tropical medicine on people with hiv is being prepared for archiving without explicit consent. data are being thoroughly anonymised, researchers have assessed risk in consultation with uk data service, and ethics committee has reviewed and agreed to sharing under controlled conditions. uk data service advises that data sharing without explicit consent can be permissible on case-by-case basis if factors above are given proper consideration. in such cases, we communicate with depositors to ensure that they clearly understand their and our responsibilities for deposited data."]

[ "preparing data for archiving how do i prepare my dataset for secondary research? data should be prepared in such way to enable data to be used by other researchers, and for data archive to be able to create accurate catalogue records. researchers are encouraged to document data appropriately, (see our guidance on data documentation and metadata), to include research procedures and fieldwork methods and to ensure that data are held in organised manner. documentation is invaluable in enabling secondary users to contextualise data and conduct better informed re-use of material. any consent and confidentiality concerns which may inhibit archiving data should be resolved. see our guidance on consent and confidentiality. what are costs of preparing data and documentation for archiving? there should be no additional costs for archiving data, other than researcher(s) time to prepare data and documentation for deposit. this time should be costed into application. on average it is recommended that two to three weeks are costed into average two year research grant application to prepare and collate materials for deposit. however, owing to disparate nature of research and data creation, we cannot provide advice on exact costs likely to be incurred in data preparation. various activities typically associated with preparing data are outlined below, for which you can work out appropriate costs in terms of people's time and equipment/software needed. much data preparation can be carried out as part of research process during data entry and transcription, therefore significantly reducing cost of preparing data for archiving. for quantitative/numerical data, allow time to add appropriate variable, value and code labelling to data, to create spss set up files (if relevant), to supply syntax or logical statements for derived variables etc. as part of data-level documentation. for qualitative data, provision should be made for full transcription of interviews, focus groups discussions and so on, where budget will allow. transcription cost should be included in overall research budget. if full transcription is really not feasible, interviews or focus groups should be fully summarised. for transcript in non-english languages, english summaries should be prepared for archiving, so costs for translation might be appropriate. data listing giving details of each interview should be created. consent and data confidentiality also impact on costs for archiving. consent for data archiving should be arranged during research when consent for participation and data use is obtained, or arranged afterwards. allow time to anonymise data, where required. ideally anonymisation should be undertaken during project but will need to be checked before archiving data. time involved should not be underestimated as anonymisation appropriate for archiving may require use of pseudonyms, or preparation of anonymisation key. anonymised document should be meaningful and usable by other researchers. see anonymising research data guidelines and techniques for detailed guidance. cost of digitisation of non-digital sources, e.g. if research involves work on paper-based collection, can usually be included in overall research budget. additional suggestions and requirements on preparing data and documentation for archiving can be found in 'create and manage' pages. how can other researchers understand and therefore use my data? data can only be understood and used to their full potential by other researchers if they are adequately documented, see documenting your data. any potential re-user should understand exactly how research was carried out and what data mean. data creator should provide sufficient information on objectives and methodology of research; explain data collection methods used; explicitly describe meanings of variables and codes used and any derivation, transformations or data cleaning carried out. must i transcribe interviews if i want to archive them? it is recommended that transcriptions of interviews are made. full transcriptions significantly extend potential for analysis and re-use of research collection, both by original researchers and by secondary users. transcription should be seen as step within analytical process of research, rather than as mechanical conversion of data. if interviews are not transcribed, then recorded interviews could be archived alongside summaries. see guidance on transcription. how do i transcribe interviews? audio-visually recorded interviews are usually transcribed manually, see guidance on transcription. standard transcription structure is recommended if transcripts are to be archived or if computer assisted qualitative data analysis (caqdas) software is to be used to analyse data. transcriptions possess unique identifier, adopt uniform layout, make use of speaker tags clearly indicating question/answer sequence, carry line breaks, be page numbered and carry document header giving brief details of interview: date, place, interviewer name, interviewee details, etc. who do i contact if i need further advice on preparing data for archiving?

[ "research without consent there are circumstances where no form of consent can be obtained. these situations are exceptional and will need case-by-case review and clear arguments to satisfy requirements of ethics review boards. there can be varied reasons why consent is not possible. limited capacity may prevent person from being fully informed. data may have already been collected for another purpose that did not require consent, such as government administrative data. consent may not be technically feasible in some very large scale projects. data may have been collected years ago when formal consent procedures were not standard practice. finally, if knowledge of research would invalidate method, then it may not be possible to inform participants in advance. because principle of consent is so important, proceeding without it is possible, but will be subject to rigorous ethics review. in general, such research will have to meet three conditions: clear value and benefit from doing researchno alternative research design can achieve same result, that is, deception or lack of consent is essentialthere is no or very minimal risk of harm to participants. it is also possible to share data without explicit consent, but special consideration must be given to each situation. relevant factors include: is there any language in consent form or information sheet (if any were used) that explicitly precludes data sharing, such as data will be used only for this project? in such cases, sharing is not possible. how disclosive is material? are people or organisations named or can their identities be inferred?is it personal or sensitive data under current data protection laws? if people are no longer living, then data is not defined as personal. is anything known about participants' attitudes about having their data shared? for example, in older oral histories, consent was rarely sought, but assumption of this genre is usually to share peoples' life stories. what harm, and to whom, could result from any disclosure? what about to any identifiable third parties?can data be de-identified?could data be re-submitted for ethical review? for example, historically valuable data held at london school for hygiene and tropical medicine on people with hiv is being prepared for archiving without explicit consent. data are being thoroughly anonymised, researchers have assessed risk in consultation with uk data service, and ethics committee has reviewed and agreed to sharing under controlled conditions. uk data service advises that data sharing without explicit consent can be permissible on case-by-case basis if factors above are given proper consideration. in such cases, we communicate with depositors to ensure that they clearly understand their and our responsibilities for deposited data."]

[ "consent forms must i always use consent forms when gathering data from people? no, use of written consent forms in research is not mandatory. obtaining informed consent for people's participation in research and for use of data gathered for various research purposes is ethical requirement for most research and is typically required by research ethics committees. whether such consent is obtained verbally or in writing, using brief informative statement or detailed consent form, depends on nature of research, kind of data gathered and how data will be used. although obtaining consent in writing is recommended where possible, as it reduces uncertainty over what was agreed between researcher and participant, it may be too formal for some research with people. it is responsibility of researcher to address this problem. for non-sensitive data gathered during quantitative surveys (questionnaires) or informal interviews, where no personal data are gathered or where personal identifiers are removed from data, obtaining written consent may not be required. at minimum information sheet should be provided to participants detailing nature and scope of study, identity of researcher(s) and what will happen to data collected (including any data sharing or archiving if applicable). if, however, survey extends beyond asking questions to include activities such as nurse visit, taking samples, making physical measurements, etc. then written consent is usually required. if data are collected verbally through audio-recordings, verbal consent agreements can be audio-recorded together with data. if personal data, sensitive data or confidential data are gathered during research, use of written consent forms is recommended to assure compliance with data protection act, see data protection and sharing research data and with ethical requirements. for personal and/or sensitive data to be processed, archived and disseminated by archive, explicit consent is needed from each participant. ideally this should be in writing. further information is available on options of written or oral consent, on use of consent forms and on consent in surveys under consent pages. can you help me draft my consent form that will take into consideration sharing/archiving of research data? uk data archive producer relations team can comment on draft consent forms. detailed examples for various types of research that take into account data sharing are available, see consent forms. information specific to data archiving, that explains procedures, benefits and risks of archiving and sharing data, is available for researchers, see why share data and informing research participants. how and where should i store consent forms? if consent forms contain personal information on participants that could result in disclosure of participant's identity from data, then they should be stored separately from research data (according to data protection act). length of time that consent forms should be stored will be informed by institutional or research ethics committee requirements. blank sample consent form can be archived at uk data archive alongside research data as part of documentation providing background information to data. do i submit all participants' consent forms to uk data archive when i deposit data for archiving? no, since consent forms contain personal information, they are not archived at archive alongside research data. it is researcher's or research institution's responsibility to store consent forms safely and to decide how long they should be kept. blank consent form and information sheet can be archived at archive alongside research data as documentation providing background information on data. there are two reasons for asking research participants for copyright to be transferred to researcher. first, it gives researcher right to publish extracts based on words of participant (e.g. interview or diary extract) without needing to return to participant each time to obtain permission for publishing. second, it allows researcher to authorise third party such as archive to make copies of digital materials for purpose of digital preservation."]

yes, through uk data service we can help you locate and acquire data from other data archives around world through reciprocal agreements with network of social science data archives. for example, inter-university consortium for political and social research (icpsr) at university of michigan in usa, and members of council of european social science data archives (cessda). data for several key international series can be found and requested via uk data service discover catalogue. however, some of these data collections are restricted to users at uk institutions of higher or further education. you can also search for data at individual archives via clickable maps at other data archives. additionally you can search number of european social science data archives via cessda catalogue. who can obtain data? researchers, students and teachers from any field, organisation or country may register with uk data service and obtain data. however, some data collections have restrictions on access. for example: census data (from 1971 onwards) are only made available to users from uk higher or further education institutions. commercial usage may be restricted permission may be required from depositor publications may need to be vetted by sponsoring organisation details are available in individual records of discover catalogue. in what formats are data available? most survey datasets are available to download in spss, stata and tab-delimited (suitable for use in ms excel) formats and can also be requested in other formats such as sas. other uk data service systems, including nesstar catalogue, provide these plus additional data formats, such as statistica and dbase. international multi-nation aggregate databanks are made available online via ukds-stat software, and tables can be downloaded in ms excel and comma-separated formats. qualitative data formats include ms excel, ms word and rtf. how do i gain access to data? access to data requires registration and uses federated access management (shibboleth) user authentication. you will need to have username and password to register, and further details are available from uk data service - how to access data. how much does it cost to access data? data required for non-commercial purposes can be downloaded at no cost. if data are requested on portable media e.g. cd, handling and postage and packing fees will apply. see charges for further details. can i check contents of data collection before i obtain it? discover catalogue contains full study description for each data collection and also provides access to online documentation and variable lists. online documentation includes user guides that contain information on how to use data, how data were collected, and usually original questionnaires or topic guides. online variable lists provide variable names and variable and value labels. nesstar catalogue provides details for all variables within datasets available from nesstar system, including full question text, frequency counts and other summary statistics. access to both catalogues does not require registration. however, registration is required to conduct online data analysis or to download data. can i obtain guides to using data and questionnaires? user guides accompanying each data collection contain information on how to use data, how data were collected and usually original questionnaires. these are freely available via discover catalogue and, where available, are supplied with orders/downloads. uk data service discover variables provides access to questionnaires from range of major uk and cross-national social surveys. search of questionnaires displays questions in their original context helping with questionnaire design and methods research and teaching. are there any restrictions on use of data? restrictions on use of data are outlined in end user licence (eul) that all users agree to when registering. in particular there is fundamental restriction concerning confidentiality of data. users should not attempt to use data to deliberately compromise confidentiality of individuals, households or organisations and are required to abide by current data protection act. eul also covers requirements for citation of publications and safeguarding of data. some data have additional special conditions attached to them that users must abide by. other more sensitive data require special licence to be acquired. sharing of data you obtain from us with other researchers or students and reuse of data for new purpose is restricted by terms and conditions outlined in eul. certain data collections or types of use may also require depositor permission and details are available in 'access' section of each catalogue record in uk data service discover catalogue. what is most detailed geographical level i can analyse data at? most survey datasets contain one or more geographical variables e.g. place of residence, place of work. in many data collections most detailed geographical variable available is government office region (gor) variable which allows researchers to identify broad regions, for example 'south east', 'south west, 'north east', 'north west'. see government office regions on national statistics website for more information. most survey participants are informed that their responses will only be passed on to researchers under certain conditions and that data will be fully anonymised. including more detailed geographical variables in data collection, although still anonymised, can increase risk of data disclosure. however, it is recognised that some researchers need access to more detailed data, and we do have some data collections that are detailed, yet anonymised. since these data pose higher risk of disclosure, they have additional special conditions attached to them that take form of special licence (sl). to find out which geographical variables are available in particular data collection, users should consult relevant catalogue record in data catalogue and scroll down to 'spatial units' field within 'coverage' section. variable and value labels, or further information on standard codings and where to find them, are usually available in associated documentation (freely downloadable via catalogue record). 'variables' search, for key range of data, is available from data catalogue or via nesstar catalogue. users may also find beginner's guide to uk geography on office for national statistics website helpful. can i obtain publications arising from data collections or re-use of data? we are unable to supply copies of publications, other than user guides accompanying data. however, references to publications and journal articles produced by data creators as well as those produced by secondary analysts are available in publications section for discover records for each data collection. there are also number of searchable databases of publications which cite particular data collections - see publications citing government surveys and international data and longitudinal data. can i obtain statistics? survey datasets we supply are usually computer-readable data files that require specialist software, such as spss or stata, to analyse. number of survey datasets are available to most registered users to analyse and subset online via nesstar catalogue, where basic frequency counts are freely available to all users. links to sources of ready-made statistics can be found on uk data service ready-made uk statistics. do you have any historical data? yes. uk data service has over 650 data collections covering wide range of historical topics from fifth century to mid-twentieth century. primary focus of collection is on united kingdom, although it also includes significant body of cross-national and international data collections. majority of data is statistical relating to nineteenth and twentieth century economic and social history, particularly census data. alongside its data collection there are also number of special collections, several of which are freely available online. most important of these is histpop - online historical population reports website which provides online access to complete british population reports for britain and ireland from 1801 to 1937. can i use data to identify individuals, households or organisations or for tracing family histories? unless respondents have given their permission or data are in public domain, then data are anonymised. when registering, users agree to preserve at all times confidentiality of information pertaining to individuals and/or households in data collections (where information is not in public domain). also, not to use data to attempt to obtain or derive information relating specifically to identifiable individual or household, nor to claim to have obtained or derived such information. in addition, to preserve confidentiality of information about, or supplied by, organisations recorded in data collections. some historical data collections in discover catalogue that are in public domain may be of interest to family historians/genealogists. however, uk data service is funded to preserve and disseminate electronic data created by or for historians, and genealogical research is not part of their remit. can i gain access to uk census data? you can gain access to 1971-2011 census data from uk data service census support using your uk data service registration. some data collections require extra licences to be signed. only those studying or working within uk higher and further education, and some associated institutions and research council staff, are eligible to use data. i have heard about nesstar, could you tell me more about it? nesstar is our online data browsing tool which allows users to create simple cross-tabulations of variables, export these to excel, view metadata, and download subsets of data if required. further information can be found on nesstar page. what is cessda catalogue? cessda catalogue allows you to search seamlessly across number of european social science data archives to locate data collections and variables. data can also be browsed by topic, keyword or data publisher. why do i need to cite data when ive used it? citation identifies sources for validation and further research by different researchers. by signing our end user licence, all users agree to cite data they have used. by establishing data collections as bibliographic entities and 'publishing' them as such, and by offering advice on citation, uk data archive plays major role in extending research and scholarship. creation of data collection which is properly documented and usable by other researchers deserves equivalent recognition and acknowledgement to printed work of scholarship. failure to cite data means that valuable data sources will not be indexed by bibliographical services such as social science citation indexes, and, more importantly, other researchers who would like to analyse these data may not have sufficient information to acquire them. how do i acknowledge and cite data? citation should include enough information so that exact version of data being cited can be located but does not include information on sponsor or copyright. digital object identifier (doi) is included in citation. this ensures that even if location of data changes, doi will always link to data that was used. details of citation that should be used are given in discover catalogue record for every data collection. acknowledgement is general statement giving credit to source and distributor and includes copyright information. it can be given at start of, or within text, or at end of article before bibliographic references/citations. information that should be included (e.g. depositor, sponsor) can be found in 'study information and citation' file via discover for every data collection. further information, including examples, is available from our citing data web page . some journals ask authors to make available data used for publication. how do i comply with this? some journals require authors to submit data alongside publication so that published results can be replicated by others. data obtained from our collection, including subsets and derived data, cannot be submitted to journals alongside publications as this would be breach of end user licence (eul) that users agree to when they register. however, in most cases it is sufficient for author of publication to supply information to journal about how individual can register and access data. in addition, for derived data there are number of options available including: author can supply syntax used to journal author can offer their data to uk data archive - it is requirement of eul that any derived data be offered for deposit author can request that anyone wishing to replicate results should apply to author before passing on data, it is essential for author to first check with us that any applicant is registered user and is also entitled to access data"]

[ "preparing data for archiving how do i prepare my dataset for secondary research? data should be prepared in such way to enable data to be used by other researchers, and for data archive to be able to create accurate catalogue records. researchers are encouraged to document data appropriately, (see our guidance on data documentation and metadata), to include research procedures and fieldwork methods and to ensure that data are held in organised manner. documentation is invaluable in enabling secondary users to contextualise data and conduct better informed re-use of material. any consent and confidentiality concerns which may inhibit archiving data should be resolved. see our guidance on consent and confidentiality. what are costs of preparing data and documentation for archiving? there should be no additional costs for archiving data, other than researcher(s) time to prepare data and documentation for deposit. this time should be costed into application. on average it is recommended that two to three weeks are costed into average two year research grant application to prepare and collate materials for deposit. however, owing to disparate nature of research and data creation, we cannot provide advice on exact costs likely to be incurred in data preparation. various activities typically associated with preparing data are outlined below, for which you can work out appropriate costs in terms of people's time and equipment/software needed. much data preparation can be carried out as part of research process during data entry and transcription, therefore significantly reducing cost of preparing data for archiving. for quantitative/numerical data, allow time to add appropriate variable, value and code labelling to data, to create spss set up files (if relevant), to supply syntax or logical statements for derived variables etc. as part of data-level documentation. for qualitative data, provision should be made for full transcription of interviews, focus groups discussions and so on, where budget will allow. transcription cost should be included in overall research budget. if full transcription is really not feasible, interviews or focus groups should be fully summarised. for transcript in non-english languages, english summaries should be prepared for archiving, so costs for translation might be appropriate. data listing giving details of each interview should be created. consent and data confidentiality also impact on costs for archiving. consent for data archiving should be arranged during research when consent for participation and data use is obtained, or arranged afterwards. allow time to anonymise data, where required. ideally anonymisation should be undertaken during project but will need to be checked before archiving data. time involved should not be underestimated as anonymisation appropriate for archiving may require use of pseudonyms, or preparation of anonymisation key. anonymised document should be meaningful and usable by other researchers. see anonymising research data guidelines and techniques for detailed guidance. cost of digitisation of non-digital sources, e.g. if research involves work on paper-based collection, can usually be included in overall research budget. additional suggestions and requirements on preparing data and documentation for archiving can be found in 'create and manage' pages. how can other researchers understand and therefore use my data? data can only be understood and used to their full potential by other researchers if they are adequately documented, see documenting your data. any potential re-user should understand exactly how research was carried out and what data mean. data creator should provide sufficient information on objectives and methodology of research; explain data collection methods used; explicitly describe meanings of variables and codes used and any derivation, transformations or data cleaning carried out. must i transcribe interviews if i want to archive them? it is recommended that transcriptions of interviews are made. full transcriptions significantly extend potential for analysis and re-use of research collection, both by original researchers and by secondary users. transcription should be seen as step within analytical process of research, rather than as mechanical conversion of data. if interviews are not transcribed, then recorded interviews could be archived alongside summaries. see guidance on transcription. how do i transcribe interviews? audio-visually recorded interviews are usually transcribed manually, see guidance on transcription. standard transcription structure is recommended if transcripts are to be archived or if computer assisted qualitative data analysis (caqdas) software is to be used to analyse data. transcriptions possess unique identifier, adopt uniform layout, make use of speaker tags clearly indicating question/answer sequence, carry line breaks, be page numbered and carry document header giving brief details of interview: date, place, interviewer name, interviewee details, etc. who do i contact if i need further advice on preparing data for archiving? if after reviewing information on preparing and documenting data for sharing and archiving, any query or question remains unresolved, get in touch with producer relations team through uk data service."]

[ "informing participants as part of informed consent procedures, it is important to tell participants about purpose and benefits of sharing and archiving research data and making them available for future research, so participant can take informed decision. following information can be used to explain this, with appropriate modifications for your research. what is data archive? data archive is secure place where different types of materials are stored and looked after indefinitely. most traditional archives deal with paper records, such as local history archive. in digital age many archives now hold electronic records. these demand different methods and skills to curate materials to ensure that they can be used well into future. uk data archive houses several thousand datasets of interest to researchers, teachers and students who work in social sciences or humanities, and makes this material available for use in research and learning. why put data in archive?for many participants of research study, taking part is way of getting their voices heard and of being listened to. sharing their lives and stories in in-depth interview is way for them to have say about topics that are important to them. some people are happy to have their own names attributed to material they provide, while others prefer not to. either way, providing 'voice' is essential job for archive. second reason to put materials in archive is that it is impossible for researchers to learn everything they want to from data they collect at time of their project. because so many things can be learned from data, preserving them means they can be shared with other researchers who will find data useful now and for many years to come. another important reason to archive data is that some of data have been provided by very hard-to-reach groups, politicians, sick, very elderly, socially excluded or those who otherwise are not usually included in research projects. it is often very difficult and expensive to recruit such participants for research and, once they have contributed, it is important to make full use of information they have given. lastly, archives are very good places to keep data safe and secure, providing lasting evidence of published research findings. archivists are experts in backing up data, protecting them from viruses and more. they also specialise in looking after data to make sure they can still be used many years in future when technology will be very different from today. how do i know my data will be used ethically?putting data into archive is not same as making them available on web. archivists value materials deposited with them and take their duty very seriously to make sure materials are used only in appropriate ways. their primary concern is to protect research participants. to that end, there are three strategies for protecting data. first is to gain informed consent from participants to share data; second is to anonymise data; and third is to control access to data, via licensing. in almost every archive, some data will be available to public, some will be covered by standard licence, some need special permission, and some data are made unavailable for lengthy period. what does anonymising mean?this means removing anything that could identify participant or anyone talked about in data. good examples are names of people and places. in archives, personal contact details are never made available. examples would include things such as addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses. here is example of anonymising some real names: original textanonymised text schools e.g. st john's primary schoollocal secondary school or chosen made up name businesses e.g. mcdonald'sfast food outlet/restaurant or chosen made up name family and friends' names e.g. auntie bettychanged to aunt or pseudonym how might data be used?data can be used in many ways. for example, one well-known collection known as edwardians, which interviewed 450 older people born before 1918, has been used to study topics as different as men's roles in family meal preparation, and how young civilian soldiers survived trench warfare on western front by drawing on emotional and practical support of their families. archived data may also be used by researchers, to compare with their own materials; by teachers, for use in their courses; and by journalists and policymakers. others may be interested in how research was done, e.g. how questions were asked. of course, it is almost impossible to predict all ways that data might be used. past examples have shown that users are very creative in looking at data in very new and innovative ways. who owns data and what is copyright?if you are asked to sign copyright statement this means that person asking will have legal right to use your contributions on agreed terms. for example, they can publish article on research which may quote some of your words. researcher can further sign licence with archive that allows archive to legally distribute material to bona fide researchers, under conditions agreed by researcher. how do archives store my data safely?in many archives, data are stored in conditions that meet national and international standards - temperature, security and so on. they will have licences and access controls to ensure that only authorised and registered users can get hold of data. because sharing your data can be done safely and because there are so many benefits, we hope you will agree to archive your data."]

[ "consent in special cases there are situations where special considerations are needed when seeking consent. we highlight just few of them and explain some implications for data sharing. medical researchinternet researchtwitterconsent for linking to administrative datachildren and young adultspeople with learning difficultiesresearch within organisations or in workplacecrime medical researchwhere research involves medical matters, medical research ethics committees will need to be involved to approve methodology and consent forms. researcher should also be aware of standards traditionally asserted by such committees, and at times, committees can be skeptical about data. researchers will need to fully document procedures for safely handling data, especially personal data, when sharing. all applications to research nhs patients are done through standard application form used by all nhs research ethics committees across uk. for further information see: nhs national research ethics service application and supportmedical research council ethics and research guidance internet researchincreasingly, researchers gather data from online discussion groups, blogs, social media and websites. separation between public domain and private space may be blurred. question to ask is whether to seek consent to gather and use such materials from individual, moderator or webmaster. there are no absolute answers. permission from webmaster or copyright owner should be sought if text from (public) web page is used for research, mainly for copyright reasons. if information is taken from restricted environment where members contribute information that is therefore not considered to be in public domain (chat room, forum, discussion group), then good ethical practice is to inform and seek consent for research and sharing from each individual providing information and show that this has been obtained. for further information: mrs guidelines for online researchassociation of internet researchers ethics guidancebps ethics guidelines for internet-mediated research consent and twitterpublic tweets may appear similar to public space, but there are legal and morally significant factors to consider. firstly there are constraints from twitter's terms and conditions of use. tweets may not be anonymised and authors must honour requests for change or deletion. this can become problematic if paper based on quoted tweets has already been published or twitter data is shared.researchers have duty of care to tweeter, whether content has been made public, or not. for small scale data projects, consent can be sought by: contacting tweeter directly to request permission to use tweets in researchproviding full information via websitemaking it clear to tweeters they will not be anonymous. when consent is not possible there may be alternatives, and in selected cases, consent may not be necessary. for example, consent is not necessary where data is aggregated and no identification is possible, or where tweets are from public, official or institutional accounts. it should be noted that even if tweetid is not real name tweet text can be searched and re-linked with tweeter. we would like to acknowledge assistance from matthew williams and luke sloan at social data science lab in presenting this information about consent and twitter. more detail is available from social data science lab ethics statement. consent for linking to administrative dataunderstanding society is large-scale longitudinal household panel survey, in which participants are interviewed each year. each participant completes individual questionnaire, but they are also asked if they consent to survey team linking to range of administrative data records (such as their health, education, employment and pension records). both elements of survey have different consent procedures. for annual household and individual questionnaire, participants are sent advance letter shortly before interviewers contact them. this letter reminds them about purpose of survey and asks them to participate again. people joining survey are also given information leaflet which explains more about aims of study, what is entailed in joining study and emphasises voluntary nature of their participation. this voluntary participation is also re-emphasised at key points throughout interviews. no written consent is sought, rather it is implied through their participation in interview. for administrative data linkage, participants are given information leaflet during interview which explains important aspects of data linkage. leaflet contains information on what data study is interested in, who will use data, data security, what their consent covers and how long it lasts and how to withdraw their consent. participants are given time to read this leaflet, and then asked to read and sign consent form. you can view information leaflets and consent forms that were used in wave 4 of study. research with children and young adultsresearch participants must be provided with full information about research in order to give their informed consent to take part. careful thought needs to be given to translating this into practice when participant is child. clearest guidance on consent from children can be found in advice for clinical practice which presumes, based on legal ruling, that young people aged 16 years and above can give their own consent. for younger children, judgement must be made about their ability to understand what is being asked of them. information must be given in clear language at level that child can understand, using visual aids if necessary. in this way they can be asked for their individual voluntary consent, in addition to that of parent/guardian and/or head teacher. due to their legal status as minor and implied vulnerability that this status confers, researcher often has to negotiate access to children via gatekeepers (e.g. teachers or carers), who through their relationship with child are assumed to have protective role. gatekeepers will require information about research, how consent will be obtained from children and responsible adults and extent of confidentiality, prior to approving access to children. in other situations gatekeepers control physical access to children, such as in schools, where permission is needed to make initial contact with parents. again, in order to gain access to children, researchers may be asked to make changes to their data collection instruments or to require parents to take positive action, i.e. elect for their child to 'opt in' to research. confidentiality, anonymity, storage and sharing of data should be explained in way that children can understand. it should also be made clear who will have access to information and what will happen to it when research is complete. information can be given about how data will be used, in same clear language as used about research. it is recommended that written information should always be provided for child and responsible adult, including contact telephone number, should they wish to contact researchers. see example consent form for research with children. for further information see: informed consent, gatekeepers and go-betweens: negotiating consent in child- and youth-orientated institutions informed consent and research process: following rules or striking balances? guidelines for research with children and young people people with learning difficultiesresearch with people who have learning difficulties raises questions of ownership, power and exploitation which reflect ethical concerns of much general research but which can be more problematic and therefore need special consideration. revealing sensitive material in records, or stirring of painful memories of past during interviews also raises another ethical issue about need to provide support for those who are involved in this type of research. extra time needs to be built into project for these concerns. particular attention should be paid to discussion of purpose and implications of research and data sharing and to ensuring that these have been understood. use of any documentation or consent form needs to be appropriate, recognising adult status, but at same time being accessible. careful attention should be paid to use of language. cartoons or drawings run risk of being patronising, whereas appropriate photographs or diagrams combined with clear statements in large print and double spacing can create attractive and informative form to be referred to by participants. one way of enabling people to understand as clearly as possible implications of their named participation in research is to discuss with them who is likely to read published research, and who will have access to archived material. examples of such literature can be shown and discussed. books are significant and powerful examples of public realm even for those who cannot read. in cases where researcher finds it difficult to understand participant, it is important to find interpreter i.e. friend, relation, or long-term carer. research within organisations or in workplaceresearch with people within organisation or workplace will need additional consent if work is to be discussed. information given by employee in interview which takes place during course of employment (typically on work premises) should not be used unless employer has given consent. this is because employees may be seen to owe duty of confidentiality to their employer. indeed employment contracts may contain confidentiality clauses. it is always advisable when carrying out research with someone in workplace, in working hours, to discuss whether consent from employers is necessary. it is responsibility of researcher to be aware of policy of each organisation. see example consent form for use with interviews in workplace. crimeresearch into crime requires different form of consent. participants should be made aware that researcher may under some circumstances need to disclose information relating to criminal activity. normally, there is no legal obligation to disclose information relating to criminal activity - unless legal proceedings or investigation are underway. even then, confidants will only be guilty of perverting course of justice if they deliberately evade questioning. they are therefore unlikely to be under legal duty to disclose unless actually approached by police with regard to specific information or case in question. for further information see: british society of criminology code of ethics for researchers in field of criminology"]

[ "about uk data archive what are data archives? data archives are resource centres for analysts who use data for research and teaching. their functions usually include: ensuring that data are preserved against technological obsolescence and physical damage checking, validating and preparing data and accompanying user documentation cataloguing their technical and substantive properties for information and retrieval supplying them in appropriate form to secondary users supporting users in using data social science data archiving movement began in 1960s within number of key social science departments in united states who stored original coded interview data deriving from academic surveys. movement spread across europe and in 1967 uk data archive ( archive) was established by uk social science research council (now economic and social research council (esrc)). in late 1970s many national archives joined wider professional organisations to foster co-operation on key archival strategies, procedures and technologies; encourage exchange of data and technology across national boundaries; and promote acquisition, archiving and distribution of electronic data for social science teaching and research. what services does uk data archive provide? uk data archive is curator of largest collection of digital data in social sciences and humanities in united kingdom. with several thousand datasets relating to society, both historical and contemporary, our archive is vital resource for researchers, teachers and learners. we acquire high quality data from academic, public, and commercial sectors, providing continuous access to these data while we also support existing and emerging and communities of data users. we are acknowledged centre of expertise in areas of acquiring, curating and providing access to data. since 2005 our archive has been designated place of deposit by national archives allowing us to curate public records. we direct and manage uk data service which is uk's flagship portal for research resources, where we host key national and international survey data, databanks, census data and and qualitative data. more recently we have been providing secure access to disclosive and more sensitive data. we have been engaged in number of data management initiatives supported by esrc and jisc including running rural economy and land use programme (relu) data support service which focused on providing access to key environmental data. we also provide curation of data for other organisations at cost. we are proud to be actively engaged in research and development, and throughout our 40+ year history, we have remained at cutting edge to become international leader in curating and sharing data. where do your data come from? data collections are deposited from variety of sources, including academic researchers, government departments, intergovernmental organisations, independent research institutes, and market research organisations. academic research funded by economic and social research council (esrc) is important source of data, as council operates mandatory datasets policy whereby all award holders are expected to offer data to uk data archive for archiving. examples of large-scale esrc datasets are british social attitudes survey (bsas), british election studies (bes) and british household panel study (bhps). censuses and large surveys carried out by governments for their own policy purposes are particularly rich sources of data for further exploration. central government, and in particular, office for national statistics (ons) is major and regular supplier of data series, including general household survey (ghs), labour force survey (lfs), and health survey for england (hse). some data collections may not have been collected specifically for research purposes. administrative databases, such as national health service patient re-registrations, although collected for very different purpose, can provide valuable and timely information for researchers. what is uk data service? uk data service provides unified point of access to extensive range of high quality social and economic data, including census data, government funded surveys, longitudinal studies, international macrodata, qualitative data and business microdata. it is designed to provide seamless access and support to meet current and future research demands of both academic and non-academic users, and to help them maximise impact of their work. uk data service is new service which replaces earlier esrc investments of economic and social data service (esds), secure data service (sds), survey question bank and elements of esrc census programme. it also incorporates outputs from cross-council relu data support service (relu-dss). what happened to relu data support service? rural economy and land use programme data support service (relu-dss) was dedicated support service funded by esrc, nerc ad bbsrc to provide information and guidance to researchers and project managers from programme on data management, data sharing and preservation. outputs from portal are available. what happened to esds, sds and sqb? economic and social data service (esds) is now integrated into uk data service, along with former secure data service (sds), survey question bank (sqb), elements of esrc census programme and outputs friom relu data support service. what services do you provide for guidance on research data management? research data management support services team at uk data archive is actively involved in developing knowledge, guidance and capacity building in managing and sharing data, primarily for social sciences. our up-to-date guidance can be found on uk data service website, together with links to our book published in 2014 by sage publications. we run training events on various aspects of managing and sharing research data. our team undertakes range of r&d projects on research data management support and training for researchers and research centres, through grants from esrc, jisc and eu."]

[ "research without consent there are circumstances where no form of consent can be obtained. these situations are exceptional and will need case-by-case review and clear arguments to satisfy requirements of ethics review boards. there can be varied reasons why consent is not possible. limited capacity may prevent person from being fully informed. data may have already been collected for another purpose that did not require consent, such as government administrative data. consent may not be technically feasible in some very large scale projects. data may have been collected years ago when formal consent procedures were not standard practice. finally, if knowledge of research would invalidate method, then it may not be possible to inform participants in advance. because principle of consent is so important, proceeding without it is possible, but will be subject to rigorous ethics review. in general, such research will have to meet three conditions: clear value and benefit from doing researchno alternative research design can achieve same result, that is, deception or lack of consent is essentialthere is no or very minimal risk of harm to participants. it is also possible to share data without explicit consent, but special consideration must be given to each situation. relevant factors include: is there any language in consent form or information sheet (if any were used) that explicitly precludes data sharing, such as data will be used only for this project? in such cases, sharing is not possible. how disclosive is material? are people or organisations named or can their identities be inferred?is it personal or sensitive data under current data protection laws? if people are no longer living, then data is not defined as personal. is anything known about participants' attitudes about having their data shared? for example, in older oral histories, consent was rarely sought, but assumption of this genre is usually to share peoples' life stories. what harm, and to whom, could result from any disclosure? what about to any identifiable third parties?can data be de-identified?could data be re-submitted for ethical review? for example, historically valuable data held at london school for hygiene and tropical medicine on people with hiv is being prepared for archiving without explicit consent. data are being thoroughly anonymised, researchers have assessed risk in consultation with uk data service, and ethics committee has reviewed and agreed to sharing under controlled conditions. uk data service advises that data sharing without explicit consent can be permissible on case-by-case basis if factors above are given proper consideration. in such cases, we communicate with depositors to ensure that they clearly understand their and our responsibilities for deposited data."]

[ "informing participants as part of informed consent procedures, it is important to tell participants about purpose and benefits of sharing and archiving research data and making them available for future research, so participant can take informed decision. following information can be used to explain this, with appropriate modifications for your research. what is data archive? data archive is secure place where different types of materials are stored and looked after indefinitely. most traditional archives deal with paper records, such as local history archive. in digital age many archives now hold electronic records. these demand different methods and skills to curate materials to ensure that they can be used well into future. uk data archive houses several thousand datasets of interest to researchers, teachers and students who work in social sciences or humanities, and makes this material available for use in research and learning. why put data in archive?for many participants of research study, taking part is way of getting their voices heard and of being listened to. sharing their lives and stories in in-depth interview is way for them to have say about topics that are important to them. some people are happy to have their own names attributed to material they provide, while others prefer not to. either way, providing 'voice' is essential job for archive. second reason to put materials in archive is that it is impossible for researchers to learn everything they want to from data they collect at time of their project. because so many things can be learned from data, preserving them means they can be shared with other researchers who will find data useful now and for many years to come. another important reason to archive data is that some of data have been provided by very hard-to-reach groups, politicians, sick, very elderly, socially excluded or those who otherwise are not usually included in research projects. it is often very difficult and expensive to recruit such participants for research and, once they have contributed, it is important to make full use of information they have given. lastly, archives are very good places to keep data safe and secure, providing lasting evidence of published research findings. archivists are experts in backing up data, protecting them from viruses and more. they also specialise in looking after data to make sure they can still be used many years in future when technology will be very different from today. how do i know my data will be used ethically?putting data into archive is not same as making them available on web. archivists value materials deposited with them and take their duty very seriously to make sure materials are used only in appropriate ways. their primary concern is to protect research participants. to that end, there are three strategies for protecting data. first is to gain informed consent from participants to share data; second is to anonymise data; and third is to control access to data, via licensing. in almost every archive, some data will be available to public, some will be covered by standard licence, some need special permission, and some data are made unavailable for lengthy period. what does anonymising mean?this means removing anything that could identify participant or anyone talked about in data. good examples are names of people and places. in archives, personal contact details are never made available. examples would include things such as addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses. here is example of anonymising some real names: original textanonymised text schools e.g. st john's primary schoollocal secondary school or chosen made up name businesses e.g. mcdonald'sfast food outlet/restaurant or chosen made up name family and friends' names e.g. auntie bettychanged to aunt or pseudonym how might data be used?data can be used in many ways. for example, one well-known collection known as edwardians, which interviewed 450 older people born before 1918, has been used to study topics as different as men's roles in family meal preparation, and how young civilian soldiers survived trench warfare on western front by drawing on emotional and practical support of their families. archived data may also be used by researchers, to compare with their own materials; by teachers, for use in their courses; and by journalists and policymakers. others may be interested in how research was done, e.g. how questions were asked. of course, it is almost impossible to predict all ways that data might be used. past examples have shown that users are very creative in looking at data in very new and innovative ways. who owns data and what is copyright?if you are asked to sign copyright statement this means that person asking will have legal right to use your contributions on agreed terms. for example, they can publish article on research which may quote some of your words. researcher can further sign licence with archive that allows archive to legally distribute material to bona fide researchers, under conditions agreed by researcher. how do archives store my data safely?in many archives, data are stored in conditions that meet national and international standards - temperature, security and so on. they will have licences and access controls to ensure that only authorised and registered users can get hold of data. because sharing your data can be done safely and because there are so many benefits, we hope you will agree to archive your data."]

[ "when data are shared or archived, original copyright owner retains copyright. data archive cannot archive data unless all rights holders are identified and give their permission for data to be shared. secondary users need to obtain copyright clearance before data can be reproduced. exceptions exist under fair dealing concept. fair dealing normally copyright clearance needs to be obtained from rights holder before data can be reproduced. under fair dealing concept, data can be copied for non-commercial teaching or research purposes, private study, criticism or review without infringing copyright, provided that owner of work is sufficiently acknowledged. this only applies to literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, not to films or recordings. acknowledgement should give credit to data source used, data distributor and copyright holder. for databases, if researchers use parts of data (as well as structure in which those data are held) to create another dataset, they should obtain explicit copyright and database right clearance before they publish these data. using these data solely for research purposes should not infringe any rights under concept of fair dealing where legitimate users may copy sections of material for non-commercial, teaching or research purposes. we provide some examples of rights when using existing sources. archiving data if researcher wishes to share data by archiving them, all right holders need to be identified and necessary copyright permissions granted for data to be archived and shared. archive such as uk data archive acts as 'publisher' of data and does not consider itself to have any rights in any of data collections it distributes. researcher(s) or data creator(s) keep copyright over archived data and licence archive to process and distribute data. if archive were to distribute copies of data without having explicit permission from all copyright holders, it would be breaking law. assigning copyright correctly is especially important where data collections have been created from variety of sources, for example when data have been bought or 'lent' by other researchers. archive requires written permission from all copyright owners to acquire and provide access to these materials. archive specifies how data use should be acknowledged and cited, either within metadata record for dataset or in data use licence. no obvious third-party organisation exists to negotiate rights on behalf of researchers, unlike performing rights society which administers rights relating to public performance and broadcast of musical works. in most cases researcher will need to contact rights holder, or rights holder's estate, and come to agreement whereby terms and conditions of reproduction can be laid down in agreement or licence. creative commons creative commons licences allow creators to communicate rights which they wish to keep and rights which they wish to waive in order for other people to make reuse of their intellectual properties more straightforward. for some data collections, creative commons licences may be appropriate, but creative commons itself does not recommend using creative commons licences for informational databases. other licences with similar objectives are more appropriate, such as open data commons licence or open government licence."]

[ "about uk data archive what are data archives? data archives are resource centres for analysts who use data for research and teaching. their functions usually include: ensuring that data are preserved against technological obsolescence and physical damage checking, validating and preparing data and accompanying user documentation cataloguing their technical and substantive properties for information and retrieval supplying them in appropriate form to secondary users supporting users in using data social science data archiving movement began in 1960s within number of key social science departments in united states who stored original coded interview data deriving from academic surveys. movement spread across europe and in 1967 uk data archive ( archive) was established by uk social science research council (now economic and social research council (esrc)). in late 1970s many national archives joined wider professional organisations to foster co-operation on key archival strategies, procedures and technologies; encourage exchange of data and technology across national boundaries; and promote acquisition, archiving and distribution of electronic data for social science teaching and research. what services does uk data archive provide? uk data archive is curator of largest collection of digital data in social sciences and humanities in united kingdom. with several thousand datasets relating to society, both historical and contemporary, our archive is vital resource for researchers, teachers and learners. we acquire high quality data from academic, public, and commercial sectors, providing continuous access to these data while we also support existing and emerging and communities of data users. we are acknowledged centre of expertise in areas of acquiring, curating and providing access to data. since 2005 our archive has been designated place of deposit by national archives allowing us to curate public records. we direct and manage uk data service which is uk's flagship portal for research resources, where we host key national and international survey data, databanks, census data and and qualitative data. more recently we have been providing secure access to disclosive and more sensitive data. we have been engaged in number of data management initiatives supported by esrc and jisc including running rural economy and land use programme (relu) data support service which focused on providing access to key environmental data. we also provide curation of data for other organisations at cost. we are proud to be actively engaged in research and development, and throughout our 40+ year history, we have remained at cutting edge to become international leader in curating and sharing data. where do your data come from? data collections are deposited from variety of sources, including academic researchers, government departments, intergovernmental organisations, independent research institutes, and market research organisations. academic research funded by economic and social research council (esrc) is important source of data, as council operates mandatory datasets policy whereby all award holders are expected to offer data to uk data archive for archiving. examples of large-scale esrc datasets are british social attitudes survey (bsas), british election studies (bes) and british household panel study (bhps). censuses and large surveys carried out by governments for their own policy purposes are particularly rich sources of data for further exploration. central government, and in particular, office for national statistics (ons) is major and regular supplier of data series, including general household survey (ghs), labour force survey (lfs), and health survey for england (hse). some data collections may not have been collected specifically for research purposes. administrative databases, such as national health service patient re-registrations, although collected for very different purpose, can provide valuable and timely information for researchers. what is uk data service? uk data service provides unified point of access to extensive range of high quality social and economic data, including census data, government funded surveys, longitudinal studies, international macrodata, qualitative data and business microdata. it is designed to provide seamless access and support to meet current and future research demands of both academic and non-academic users, and to help them maximise impact of their work. uk data service is new service which replaces earlier esrc investments of economic and social data service (esds), secure data service (sds), survey question bank and elements of esrc census programme. it also incorporates outputs from cross-council relu data support service (relu-dss). what happened to relu data support service? rural economy and land use programme data support service (relu-dss) was dedicated support service funded by esrc, nerc ad bbsrc to provide information and guidance to researchers and project managers from programme on data management, data sharing and preservation. outputs from portal are available. what happened to esds, sds and sqb?

[ 'metadata can describe content, context and provenance of datasets in standardised and structured manner, typically describing purpose, origin, temporal characteristics, geographic location, authorship, access conditions and terms of use of dataset. this provides structured searchable information that helps users to find existing data resources, judge whether particular dataset is suitable for their research purpose, and provides bibliographic record for citing data. metadata for online data catalogues or discovery portals are often structured to international standards or schemes, consisting of mandatory and optional elements, and rely on using controlled vocabularies and thesauri. example schemes are dublin core, iso 19115 for geographic information, data documentation initiative (ddi), statistical data and metadata exchange (sdmx), metadata encoding and transmission standard (mets) and general international standard archival description (isad(g)), and datacite metadata schema for publication and citation of digital datasets with persistent identifier.data documentation initiativethe ddi is rich and detailed metadata standard originally designed for describing social, behavioral and economic sciences data. it is used by most social science data archives in world. ddi catalogue records contain mandatory and optional metadata elements relating to study description, data file description and variable description. study description contains information about context of data collection such as bibliographic citation of study and data, scope of study, like topics, geography, time, method of data collection, sampling and processing, data access information, and information on accompanying materials. data file description indicates data format, file type, file structure, missing data, weighting variables and software used. variable descriptions indicate variable labels and codes. uk data service uses ddi to structure catalogue records. use of standardised records in extensible mark-up language (xml) brings key data documentation together into single document, creating rich and structured content about data. metadata can be harvested for data sharing through open archives initiative protocol for metadata harvesting (oai-pmh). uk data service catalogue recordsour ddi records contain mandatory and optional metadata elements on: study description - information about context of data collection such as bibliographic citation of study and data, scope of study (topics, geography, time), methodology of data collection, sampling and processing, data access information, and information on accompanying materials data file description - information on data format, file type, file structure, missing data, weighting variables and software variable descriptions we collect initial catalogue record information from our data deposit form, which is completed by data depositor. we then enhance information from accompanying documentation to create conformant metadata record. where researchers can provide detailed and meaningful data collection titles, descriptions, keywords, contextual and methodological information in deposit form, it helps us create rich resource-discovery metadata for their deposited collections. we assign keywords from our own hasset thesaurus.data citationsdepositors are encouraged to provide information about original and subsequent reports and publications or presentations based on our data collections so these references can be added as further documentation. we are always interested in capturing case studies of data reuse in our collections to encourage further use of data. we prepare standard bibliographic citation for each data collection so that users can correctly cite data sources in research outputs.']

[ 'data management and sharing activities need to be costed into research, in terms of time and resources needed. by planning early, costs can be significantly reduced. there are two approaches to costing research data management and sharing in advance of research project starting. either can be used in data management plan or can inform funding application. approach 1: all data-related activities and resources for entire data lifecycle - from data creation, through processing, analyses and storage, to sharing and long-term preservation - can be priced to calculate total cost of all data generation, data sharing, data access and preservation activities. approach 2: only resources that would be needed to preserve and make research data shareable beyond primary research team are identified. these resources may include: people, equipment, infrastructure and tools to manage, document, organise, store and provide access to data. data management costing tool there is no hard and fast rule for costing research data management, as some projects will afford more attention to detailed data documentation, organisation and formatting than others as part of routine fieldwork or data preparation before analysis. however, uk data service has developed simple activity-based costing tool that can be used for approach 2 of costing data management in social sciences. how costing tool was developed data management costing tool was developed with researchers as part of jisc data management planning for esrc research data-rich investments project, through data management interviews with researchers in esrc centres and programmes. researchers were asked to estimate time or cost needed for activities related to data collection, data entry and transcription, data validation and documentation and cost of preparing data for archiving and re-use. overall, researchers found it hard to cost data management activities, as many activities are integral part of standard research activities and data analysis. identified high cost activities were transcribing and anonymising qualitative data and cleaning and verifying quantitative data. information from researchers was then combined with our expertise in measures needed to make research data shareable and reusable. key is that when preparing data for sharing is left until end of project, cost is often too high due to competition with publishing and seeking future project funding.']

[ "We have been involved in the reviewing and evaluation of data management plans for many years. Below, you will information about these projects, how we review DMPs and common issues which we have identified with the DMPs we have assessed. ESRC DMPs The ESRC introduced a requirement for a data management plan to be submitted with every grant application in April 2011. We evaluated an anonymous sample of 25 of the first submitted data management plans, evaluating the quality of the information provided for each of those against the following eight topics: an assessment of existing data that could be used for the research information on new data that will be created quality assurance of data back-up and security of data expected difficulties in data sharing, e.g. ethical or legal issues copyright and Intellectual Property Right of data data management responsibilities preparation of data for sharing and archiving We then scored the answers to each question ([1] insufficient, [2] sufficient, [3] excellent). Each plan was evaluated twice independently by various staff members of the UK Data Archive's Research Data Management section. The average quality score for a DMP was 17, with a minimum score of 9 and a maximum score of 23. Nine DMPs scored below 16 (the score for sufficient information being provided for each topic). Six DMPs scored below 12. DMPs on average provide good to excellent information on assessing existing data and describing new data to be created (the average scores being 2.4 and 2.3 respectively). DMPs perform poorest on information about copyright and IPR of research data, with an average score of 1.8. Scores of 1 (insufficient information provided) were most common for copyright (7 plans), for data management responsibilities (5 plans) and for data preparation (5 plans). It is also worth grant applicants viewing the ESRC guidance for peer reviewers of data management plans. Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) DMPs This cross-disciplinary research programme (2005-2012) had its own data policy, with all projects preparing a data management plan at the start of a project (post funding). At the end of research research data were deposited with the UK Data Archive and the Environmental Information Data Centre. We reviewed the data management plans prepared by 29 large projects, four pilot projects that created and archived data and three fellowships (totalling 36 plans). During the review we considered whether: information provided on the data planned to be produced is adequate and realistic according to the proposed research and methodology all relevant data management aspects have been considered, with meaningful information provided in the plan where difficulties are anticipated to make data available for archiving, possible solutions have been suggested all possible obstacles to sharing data have been considered, such as ethical limitations and copyright ownership a team member with data management responsibility is in place at each participating institution For each question we evaluated whether the information provided was [1] insufficient (lacking clarity or detail), [2] adequate or [3] excellent. Each initial plan submitted could score a maximum of 18 and a minimum of 6. Most plans contained sufficiently detailed lists of the various datasets planned to be produced. In a few cases information was vague and award holders were asked to provide better or more detailed information."]

This requires clear data description, annotation, contextual information and documentation that explains how data were created or digitised, what data mean, what their content and structure are, and any manipulations that may have taken place.

after providing descriptive information for your data collection and people responsible, you can start to upload data and documentation files: browse your hard drive, cd or removable drive for file or enter url from where data file can be retrieved provide basic file-level metadata and select appropriate access level and licence related data and documentation resources can be listed with their url in 'related resources' field how do i write readme file? readme file should contain: short description for each file of its content any relationships between data files for tabular data, definitions of column headings and row labels, data codes (including missing data) and measurement units (or embed those in tabular file) for textual data, data list of all interviews, focus groups, etc. example of dataset with good readme file. how do i compile data list? data list gives tabular overview of collection of interview transcripts and/or recordings or other qualitative data items. it typically lists data items in collection (e.g. transcripts), some characteristics of people that were interviewed (gender, age, profession, expertise), reason they were selected for interview, and when and where interview took place. it helps re-users of data collection to easily understand and find relevant transcripts or items within data collection. example dataset with good data list. further guidance is available. what is essential documentation to upload? readme file questionnaire form or data dictionary for survey data interview schedules and questions lists for interview data methods descriptions to understand how your data were collected consent forms and information sheets. what happens if i only have documentation but no data? for esrc grants we still encourage deposit of study materials such as fieldwork method instruments and methods documentation, even if data cannot be made available. documentation should be chosen as material type when uploading these files. how do i deposit data linked to data paper in journal? follow our standard procedures to deposit data in reshare. in addition: indicate that your dataset is linked to peer-reviewed data paper in 'notes on access' field, including journal name once you have deposited your dataset for review we will send you data citation with unique identifier (doi) to include in your data paper or data descriptor we will liaise with data journal to facilitate peer review why does my data collection need to be reviewed? your data will be reviewed by our staff before we publish them, to make sure that they are not disclosive, nor unusable and well documented for future uses. how do i publish my data in reshare? after completing all mandatory metadata fields and uploading your data and documentation files, deposit your collection for review. we will publish your data after they have been reviewed. how do i manage my data in reshare? you can review status of your data collection on 'my data' page. once data collection has been published and you need to upload further data files, new version should be created for data collection. after deposit this is again reviewed before publication. who can access my data? metadata records and documentation files. as depositor you can decide access level for your data files. you set this for each file after uploading file. access options are: open data are accessible to any user without registration safeguarded data are accessible only to users registered with uk data service permission access requires specific authorisation from data owner (depositor) to release data to user how do i find my esrc award number? your esrc award number can be found by searching in rcuk gateway to research. what is doi? we give each data collection persistent identifier in form of datacite digital object identifier (doi). this doi uniquely identifies particular data collection, and ensures that it will remain findable when cited. how do i download reshare data? access to datasets depends on access level that depositor has set for each file. in general documentation files are openly accessible to all users and can be downloaded without registration. for data files three access levels exists: open data are accessible to any user without registration safeguarded data are accessible only to users registered with uk data service; you will automatically be directed to login / registration page when downloading such file closed access data requires specific authorisation from data owner (depositor) to release data to user; follow these steps to request access: email contact person for data collection to get written permission, explaining how you want to use data collection register with uk data service submit your access request via uk data service helpdesk, including data collection number after we contact you please forward permission email/letter to us we will send you data files using essex zendto service how do i request access to data that have closed access? follow these steps to request access: email contact person for data collection to get written permission, explaining how you want to use data collection register with uk data service submit your access request via uk data service helpdesk, including data collection number after we contact you please forward permission email/letter to us we will send you data files using essex zendto service when i try to download data file from reshare, i am sent to uk data service registration page, although i have already registered, what do i do? please close your browser (all tabs), clear your history and cache. then try to login again. else, try to use different browser. for my research i collected twitter data; can these be deposited with uk data service as evidence for my research and for future re-use? we are discussing permissions to accept such data. for now deposit tweetids, userids and timestamps, but not textual tweet content or further details about person sending tweet. detailed information is available in preserving social media report. is upload of data files into reshare secure? yes, data files are uploaded to reshare via https connection."]

[ "preparing data for archiving how do i prepare my dataset for secondary research? data should be prepared in such way to enable data to be used by other researchers, and for data archive to be able to create accurate catalogue records. researchers are encouraged to document data appropriately, (see our guidance on data documentation and metadata), to include research procedures and fieldwork methods and to ensure that data are held in organised manner. documentation is invaluable in enabling secondary users to contextualise data and conduct better informed re-use of material. any consent and confidentiality concerns which may inhibit archiving data should be resolved. see our guidance on consent and confidentiality. what are costs of preparing data and documentation for archiving? there should be no additional costs for archiving data, other than researcher(s) time to prepare data and documentation for deposit. this time should be costed into application. on average it is recommended that two to three weeks are costed into average two year research grant application to prepare and collate materials for deposit. however, owing to disparate nature of research and data creation, we cannot provide advice on exact costs likely to be incurred in data preparation. various activities typically associated with preparing data are outlined below, for which you can work out appropriate costs in terms of people's time and equipment/software needed. much data preparation can be carried out as part of research process during data entry and transcription, therefore significantly reducing cost of preparing data for archiving. for quantitative/numerical data, allow time to add appropriate variable, value and code labelling to data, to create spss set up files (if relevant), to supply syntax or logical statements for derived variables etc. as part of data-level documentation. for qualitative data, provision should be made for full transcription of interviews, focus groups discussions and so on, where budget will allow. transcription cost should be included in overall research budget. if full transcription is really not feasible, interviews or focus groups should be fully summarised. for transcript in non-english languages, english summaries should be prepared for archiving, so costs for translation might be appropriate. data listing giving details of each interview should be created. consent and data confidentiality also impact on costs for archiving. consent for data archiving should be arranged during research when consent for participation and data use is obtained, or arranged afterwards. allow time to anonymise data, where required. ideally anonymisation should be undertaken during project but will need to be checked before archiving data. time involved should not be underestimated as anonymisation appropriate for archiving may require use of pseudonyms, or preparation of anonymisation key. anonymised document should be meaningful and usable by other researchers. see anonymising research data guidelines and techniques for detailed guidance. cost of digitisation of non-digital sources, e.g. if research involves work on paper-based collection, can usually be included in overall research budget. additional suggestions and requirements on preparing data and documentation for archiving can be found in 'create and manage' pages. how can other researchers understand and therefore use my data? data can only be understood and used to their full potential by other researchers if they are adequately documented, see documenting your data. any potential re-user should understand exactly how research was carried out and what data mean. data creator should provide sufficient information on objectives and methodology of research; explain data collection methods used; explicitly describe meanings of variables and codes used and any derivation, transformations or data cleaning carried out. must i transcribe interviews if i want to archive them? it is recommended that transcriptions of interviews are made. full transcriptions significantly extend potential for analysis and re-use of research collection, both by original researchers and by secondary users. transcription should be seen as step within analytical process of research, rather than as mechanical conversion of data. if interviews are not transcribed, then recorded interviews could be archived alongside summaries. see guidance on transcription. how do i transcribe interviews? audio-visually recorded interviews are usually transcribed manually, see guidance on transcription. standard transcription structure is recommended if transcripts are to be archived or if computer assisted qualitative data analysis (caqdas) software is to be used to analyse data. transcriptions possess unique identifier, adopt uniform layout, make use of speaker tags clearly indicating question/answer sequence, carry line breaks, be page numbered and carry document header giving brief details of interview: date, place, interviewer name, interviewee details, etc. who do i contact if i need further advice on preparing data for archiving?

[ "if identity of research participants is to be kept confidential (for example if this is agreed with participants), then risks of disclosure need to be considered before, during and after data are collected.//nassessing disclosure risk is done by evaluating key characteristics or variables in data files that are most risky for leading to participant identification in specific project. these can be direct identifiers (e.g. person's name, national insurance number, picture or detailed geographic location) or indirect identifiers (e.g. large household size, specialised profession, unusual health conditions, verbatim textual responses to survey questions).risk assessment is about managing risk, rather than removal of all risk. risk of identification and risk of harm from exposing data are evaluated together to assess overall risk.risk analysis can involve running frequency analyses of variables to determine low-frequency responses and extreme outliers. this needs to be complemented by qualitative analysis of risk characteristics based on local knowledge of data and population and individuals studied. for example, single house with solar panels in small rural village may be highly disclosive if this is not common feature in that area. it is important to decide whether confidentiality is sufficiently served by concealing individual and household identities, or whether community or other location-specific identifiers also need to be concealed. once disclosure assessment has been completed, relevant strategies for consent protocols, anonymisation, and regulation of data access can be evaluated and applied. millennium villages study examplethis table shows examples of some assessed variables, with risk and actions taken, from review we carried out of household survey data from millennium villages impact evaluation project, northern ghana. it shows examples of direct identifiers commonly assessed for disclosure risk (age, community) as well as variables for which local knowledge is essential to indicate risk (fuel type use and house wall material).extract of household survey variables assessed for disclosure risk variablesdisclosure risk. action community low frequency counts for all named communities; respondents are very easily identifiable (especially in combination with other variables) exclude variable from dataset age low counts of older respondents over 75 years old top-code age &gt;= 75 as '75 and over' main occupation during last 12 months low counts of very specific occupations occupations aggregated into standard occupation codes ethnicity of household head low counts of specific ethnicities recode low-frequency responses (all responses but 'mamprusi' and 'builsa') into 'other' household's primary type or energy/fuel used for cooking very low counts for 'gas/lpg' and 'electricity-solar panel' responses may lead to household identification (especially if combined with other datasets) recode all responses into following main categories: 1 - 'firewood'; 2 - 'electricity-based'; 3- 'charcoal'; 4 - 'other', 5 - 'don't know'; 6 - 'na/missing' main material of wall of house number of low-frequency responses; exterior features of buildings area easily identifiable and could result in identification of household as main material of wall refers to exterior of building, it may be advisable to recode low-frequency and 'other' variables into 'other (incl. wood-based and stone-based') and retain remaining groups"]

uk data archive is curator of largest collection of digital data in social sciences and humanities in united kingdom. with several thousand datasets relating to society, both historical and contemporary, our archive is vital resource for researchers, teachers and learners. we acquire high quality data from academic, public, and commercial sectors, providing continuous access to these data while we also support existing and emerging and communities of data users. we are acknowledged centre of expertise in areas of acquiring, curating and providing access to data. since 2005 our archive has been designated place of deposit by national archives allowing us to curate public records. we direct and manage uk data service which is uk's flagship portal for research resources, where we host key national and international survey data, databanks, census data and and qualitative data. more recently we have been providing secure access to disclosive and more sensitive data. we have been engaged in number of data management initiatives supported by esrc and jisc including running rural economy and land use programme (relu) data support service which focused on providing access to key environmental data. we also provide curation of data for other organisations at cost. we are proud to be actively engaged in research and development, and throughout our 40+ year history, we have remained at cutting edge to become international leader in curating and sharing data. where do your data come from? data collections are deposited from variety of sources, including academic researchers, government departments, intergovernmental organisations, independent research institutes, and market research organisations. academic research funded by economic and social research council (esrc) is important source of data, as council operates mandatory datasets policy whereby all award holders are expected to offer data to uk data archive for archiving. examples of large-scale esrc datasets are british social attitudes survey (bsas), british election studies (bes) and british household panel study (bhps). censuses and large surveys carried out by governments for their own policy purposes are particularly rich sources of data for further exploration. central government, and in particular, office for national statistics (ons) is major and regular supplier of data series, including general household survey (ghs), labour force survey (lfs), and health survey for england (hse). some data collections may not have been collected specifically for research purposes. administrative databases, such as national health service patient re-registrations, although collected for very different purpose, can provide valuable and timely information for researchers. what is uk data service? uk data service provides unified point of access to extensive range of high quality social and economic data, including census data, government funded surveys, longitudinal studies, international macrodata, qualitative data and business microdata. it is designed to provide seamless access and support to meet current and future research demands of both academic and non-academic users, and to help them maximise impact of their work. uk data service is new service which replaces earlier esrc investments of economic and social data service (esds), secure data service (sds), survey question bank and elements of esrc census programme. it also incorporates outputs from cross-council relu data support service (relu-dss). what happened to relu data support service?

[ "informing participants as part of informed consent procedures, it is important to tell participants about purpose and benefits of sharing and archiving research data and making them available for future research, so participant can take informed decision. following information can be used to explain this, with appropriate modifications for your research. what is data archive? data archive is secure place where different types of materials are stored and looked after indefinitely. most traditional archives deal with paper records, such as local history archive. in digital age many archives now hold electronic records. these demand different methods and skills to curate materials to ensure that they can be used well into future. uk data archive houses several thousand datasets of interest to researchers, teachers and students who work in social sciences or humanities, and makes this material available for use in research and learning. why put data in archive?for many participants of research study, taking part is way of getting their voices heard and of being listened to. sharing their lives and stories in in-depth interview is way for them to have say about topics that are important to them. some people are happy to have their own names attributed to material they provide, while others prefer not to. either way, providing 'voice' is essential job for archive. second reason to put materials in archive is that it is impossible for researchers to learn everything they want to from data they collect at time of their project. because so many things can be learned from data, preserving them means they can be shared with other researchers who will find data useful now and for many years to come. another important reason to archive data is that some of data have been provided by very hard-to-reach groups, politicians, sick, very elderly, socially excluded or those who otherwise are not usually included in research projects. it is often very difficult and expensive to recruit such participants for research and, once they have contributed, it is important to make full use of information they have given. lastly, archives are very good places to keep data safe and secure, providing lasting evidence of published research findings. archivists are experts in backing up data, protecting them from viruses and more. they also specialise in looking after data to make sure they can still be used many years in future when technology will be very different from today. how do i know my data will be used ethically?putting data into archive is not same as making them available on web. archivists value materials deposited with them and take their duty very seriously to make sure materials are used only in appropriate ways. their primary concern is to protect research participants. to that end, there are three strategies for protecting data. first is to gain informed consent from participants to share data; second is to anonymise data; and third is to control access to data, via licensing. in almost every archive, some data will be available to public, some will be covered by standard licence, some need special permission, and some data are made unavailable for lengthy period. what does anonymising mean?this means removing anything that could identify participant or anyone talked about in data. good examples are names of people and places. in archives, personal contact details are never made available. examples would include things such as addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses. here is example of anonymising some real names: original textanonymised text schools e.g. st john's primary schoollocal secondary school or chosen made up name businesses e.g. mcdonald'sfast food outlet/restaurant or chosen made up name family and friends' names e.g. auntie bettychanged to aunt or pseudonym how might data be used?data can be used in many ways. for example, one well-known collection known as edwardians, which interviewed 450 older people born before 1918, has been used to study topics as different as men's roles in family meal preparation, and how young civilian soldiers survived trench warfare on western front by drawing on emotional and practical support of their families. archived data may also be used by researchers, to compare with their own materials; by teachers, for use in their courses; and by journalists and policymakers. others may be interested in how research was done, e.g. how questions were asked. of course, it is almost impossible to predict all ways that data might be used. past examples have shown that users are very creative in looking at data in very new and innovative ways. who owns data and what is copyright?if you are asked to sign copyright statement this means that person asking will have legal right to use your contributions on agreed terms. for example, they can publish article on research which may quote some of your words. researcher can further sign licence with archive that allows archive to legally distribute material to bona fide researchers, under conditions agreed by researcher. how do archives store my data safely?in many archives, data are stored in conditions that meet national and international standards - temperature, security and so on. they will have licences and access controls to ensure that only authorised and registered users can get hold of data. because sharing your data can be done safely and because there are so many benefits, we hope you will agree to archive your data."]

uk data archive is curator of largest collection of digital data in social sciences and humanities in united kingdom. with several thousand datasets relating to society, both historical and contemporary, our archive is vital resource for researchers, teachers and learners. we acquire high quality data from academic, public, and commercial sectors, providing continuous access to these data while we also support existing and emerging and communities of data users. we are acknowledged centre of expertise in areas of acquiring, curating and providing access to data. since 2005 our archive has been designated place of deposit by national archives allowing us to curate public records. we direct and manage uk data service which is uk's flagship portal for research resources, where we host key national and international survey data, databanks, census data and and qualitative data. more recently we have been providing secure access to disclosive and more sensitive data. we have been engaged in number of data management initiatives supported by esrc and jisc including running rural economy and land use programme (relu) data support service which focused on providing access to key environmental data. we also provide curation of data for other organisations at cost. we are proud to be actively engaged in research and development, and throughout our 40+ year history, we have remained at cutting edge to become international leader in curating and sharing data. where do your data come from? data collections are deposited from variety of sources, including academic researchers, government departments, intergovernmental organisations, independent research institutes, and market research organisations. academic research funded by economic and social research council (esrc) is important source of data, as council operates mandatory datasets policy whereby all award holders are expected to offer data to uk data archive for archiving. examples of large-scale esrc datasets are british social attitudes survey (bsas), british election studies (bes) and british household panel study (bhps). censuses and large surveys carried out by governments for their own policy purposes are particularly rich sources of data for further exploration. central government, and in particular, office for national statistics (ons) is major and regular supplier of data series, including general household survey (ghs), labour force survey (lfs), and health survey for england (hse). some data collections may not have been collected specifically for research purposes. administrative databases, such as national health service patient re-registrations, although collected for very different purpose, can provide valuable and timely information for researchers. what is uk data service? uk data service provides unified point of access to extensive range of high quality social and economic data, including census data, government funded surveys, longitudinal studies, international macrodata, qualitative data and business microdata. it is designed to provide seamless access and support to meet current and future research demands of both academic and non-academic users, and to help them maximise impact of their work. uk data service is new service which replaces earlier esrc investments of economic and social data service (esds), secure data service (sds), survey question bank and elements of esrc census programme. it also incorporates outputs from cross-council relu data support service (relu-dss). what happened to relu data support service? rural economy and land use programme data support service (relu-dss) was dedicated support service funded by esrc, nerc ad bbsrc to provide information and guidance to researchers and project managers from programme on data management, data sharing and preservation. outputs from portal are available. what happened to esds, sds and sqb? economic and social data service (esds) is now integrated into uk data service, along with former secure data service (sds), survey question bank (sqb), elements of esrc census programme and outputs friom relu data support service. what services do you provide for guidance on research data management? research data management support services team at uk data archive is actively involved in developing knowledge, guidance and capacity building in managing and sharing data, primarily for social sciences. our up-to-date guidance can be found on uk data service website, together with links to our book published in 2014 by sage publications. we run training events on various aspects of managing and sharing research data. our team undertakes range of r&d projects on research data management support and training for researchers and research centres, through grants from esrc, jisc and eu."]

[ 'written or verbal consent whether informed consent is obtained in writing through detailed consent form, by means of signing informative statement, or verbally, depends on nature of research, kind of data gathered, data format and how data will be used. written more solid legal ground, e.g. participant agrees to disclose personal informationoften required by ethics committeesoffers more protection for researchernot possible for some cases: illiteracy, infirm participants, participants wary of formal documentation (illegal activities, refugees) informal research setting verbal can be difficult to make all issues clear verballypossibly greater risks for researcherbest if recorded (audio or video) for detailed interviews or research where personal, sensitive or confidential data are gathered, use of written consent forms is recommended to ensure compliance with ethical requirements and data protection act. written consent should be gained wherever possible to ensure that information is being collected and provided in consistent and uniform way. it may also serve to protect both researchers and participants should any form of dispute arise. some guidelines and certain research ethics committees, research governance boards or other bodies make statements indicating (or strongly implying) that written consent is required or mandatory. this is not case in uk. while we advocate use of written forms, there are cases where it is not appropriate and flexibility in evaluating projects on their individual merits is essential.']

[ "consent in special cases there are situations where special considerations are needed when seeking consent. we highlight just few of them and explain some implications for data sharing. medical researchinternet researchtwitterconsent for linking to administrative datachildren and young adultspeople with learning difficultiesresearch within organisations or in workplacecrime medical researchwhere research involves medical matters, medical research ethics committees will need to be involved to approve methodology and consent forms. researcher should also be aware of standards traditionally asserted by such committees, and at times, committees can be skeptical about data. researchers will need to fully document procedures for safely handling data, especially personal data, when sharing. all applications to research nhs patients are done through standard application form used by all nhs research ethics committees across uk. for further information see: nhs national research ethics service application and supportmedical research council ethics and research guidance internet researchincreasingly, researchers gather data from online discussion groups, blogs, social media and websites. separation between public domain and private space may be blurred. question to ask is whether to seek consent to gather and use such materials from individual, moderator or webmaster. there are no absolute answers. permission from webmaster or copyright owner should be sought if text from (public) web page is used for research, mainly for copyright reasons. if information is taken from restricted environment where members contribute information that is therefore not considered to be in public domain (chat room, forum, discussion group), then good ethical practice is to inform and seek consent for research and sharing from each individual providing information and show that this has been obtained. for further information: mrs guidelines for online researchassociation of internet researchers ethics guidancebps ethics guidelines for internet-mediated research consent and twitterpublic tweets may appear similar to public space, but there are legal and morally significant factors to consider. firstly there are constraints from twitter's terms and conditions of use. tweets may not be anonymised and authors must honour requests for change or deletion. this can become problematic if paper based on quoted tweets has already been published or twitter data is shared.researchers have duty of care to tweeter, whether content has been made public, or not. for small scale data projects, consent can be sought by: contacting tweeter directly to request permission to use tweets in researchproviding full information via websitemaking it clear to tweeters they will not be anonymous. when consent is not possible there may be alternatives, and in selected cases, consent may not be necessary. for example, consent is not necessary where data is aggregated and no identification is possible, or where tweets are from public, official or institutional accounts. it should be noted that even if tweetid is not real name tweet text can be searched and re-linked with tweeter. we would like to acknowledge assistance from matthew williams and luke sloan at social data science lab in presenting this information about consent and twitter. more detail is available from social data science lab ethics statement. consent for linking to administrative dataunderstanding society is large-scale longitudinal household panel survey, in which participants are interviewed each year. each participant completes individual questionnaire, but they are also asked if they consent to survey team linking to range of administrative data records (such as their health, education, employment and pension records). both elements of survey have different consent procedures. for annual household and individual questionnaire, participants are sent advance letter shortly before interviewers contact them. this letter reminds them about purpose of survey and asks them to participate again. people joining survey are also given information leaflet which explains more about aims of study, what is entailed in joining study and emphasises voluntary nature of their participation. this voluntary participation is also re-emphasised at key points throughout interviews. no written consent is sought, rather it is implied through their participation in interview. for administrative data linkage, participants are given information leaflet during interview which explains important aspects of data linkage. leaflet contains information on what data study is interested in, who will use data, data security, what their consent covers and how long it lasts and how to withdraw their consent. participants are given time to read this leaflet, and then asked to read and sign consent form. you can view information leaflets and consent forms that were used in wave 4 of study. research with children and young adultsresearch participants must be provided with full information about research in order to give their informed consent to take part. careful thought needs to be given to translating this into practice when participant is child. clearest guidance on consent from children can be found in advice for clinical practice which presumes, based on legal ruling, that young people aged 16 years and above can give their own consent. for younger children, judgement must be made about their ability to understand what is being asked of them. information must be given in clear language at level that child can understand, using visual aids if necessary. in this way they can be asked for their individual voluntary consent, in addition to that of parent/guardian and/or head teacher. due to their legal status as minor and implied vulnerability that this status confers, researcher often has to negotiate access to children via gatekeepers (e.g. teachers or carers), who through their relationship with child are assumed to have protective role. gatekeepers will require information about research, how consent will be obtained from children and responsible adults and extent of confidentiality, prior to approving access to children. in other situations gatekeepers control physical access to children, such as in schools, where permission is needed to make initial contact with parents. again, in order to gain access to children, researchers may be asked to make changes to their data collection instruments or to require parents to take positive action, i.e. elect for their child to 'opt in' to research. confidentiality, anonymity, storage and sharing of data should be explained in way that children can understand. it should also be made clear who will have access to information and what will happen to it when research is complete. information can be given about how data will be used, in same clear language as used about research. it is recommended that written information should always be provided for child and responsible adult, including contact telephone number, should they wish to contact researchers. see example consent form for research with children. for further information see: informed consent, gatekeepers and go-betweens: negotiating consent in child- and youth-orientated institutions informed consent and research process: following rules or striking balances? guidelines for research with children and young people people with learning difficultiesresearch with people who have learning difficulties raises questions of ownership, power and exploitation which reflect ethical concerns of much general research but which can be more problematic and therefore need special consideration. revealing sensitive material in records, or stirring of painful memories of past during interviews also raises another ethical issue about need to provide support for those who are involved in this type of research. extra time needs to be built into project for these concerns. particular attention should be paid to discussion of purpose and implications of research and data sharing and to ensuring that these have been understood. use of any documentation or consent form needs to be appropriate, recognising adult status, but at same time being accessible. careful attention should be paid to use of language. cartoons or drawings run risk of being patronising, whereas appropriate photographs or diagrams combined with clear statements in large print and double spacing can create attractive and informative form to be referred to by participants. one way of enabling people to understand as clearly as possible implications of their named participation in research is to discuss with them who is likely to read published research, and who will have access to archived material. examples of such literature can be shown and discussed. books are significant and powerful examples of public realm even for those who cannot read. in cases where researcher finds it difficult to understand participant, it is important to find interpreter i.e. friend, relation, or long-term carer. research within organisations or in workplaceresearch with people within organisation or workplace will need additional consent if work is to be discussed. information given by employee in interview which takes place during course of employment (typically on work premises) should not be used unless employer has given consent. this is because employees may be seen to owe duty of confidentiality to their employer. indeed employment contracts may contain confidentiality clauses. it is always advisable when carrying out research with someone in workplace, in working hours, to discuss whether consent from employers is necessary. it is responsibility of researcher to be aware of policy of each organisation. see example consent form for use with interviews in workplace. crimeresearch into crime requires different form of consent. participants should be made aware that researcher may under some circumstances need to disclose information relating to criminal activity. normally, there is no legal obligation to disclose information relating to criminal activity - unless legal proceedings or investigation are underway. even then, confidants will only be guilty of perverting course of justice if they deliberately evade questioning. they are therefore unlikely to be under legal duty to disclose unless actually approached by police with regard to specific information or case in question. for further information see: british society of criminology code of ethics for researchers in field of criminology"]

[ 'data management plan helps achieve optimal handling, organising, documenting and enhancing of research data. it is particularly important for facilitating data sharing, ensuring sustainability and accessibility of data in long-term, and allowing data to be reused for future research. for effective management of data, planning must start when research is being designed and needs to consider both how data will be managed during research and how they will be shared afterwards. this involves thinking critically of how research data can be shared, what might limit or prohibit data sharing, and whether any steps can be taken to remove such limitations many public research funders require data management and sharing plan as part of research grant applications, and expect data to be shared. in uk, all seven research councils require data management plans, as do wellcome trust, dfid and cancer research uk; esrc introduced this requirement in 2011. key issues for data management planning in research know your legal, ethical and other obligations regarding research data, towards research participants, colleagues, research funders and institutions implement good practices in consistent manner assign roles and responsibilities to relevant parties in research design data management according to needs and purpose of research be trained in data management and sharing topics incorporate data management measures as integral part of your research cycle implement and review data management throughout research as part of research progression and review our data management checklist can point you to key matters to consider in data management and sharing plan.']

[ "preparing data for archiving how do i prepare my dataset for secondary research? data should be prepared in such way to enable data to be used by other researchers, and for data archive to be able to create accurate catalogue records. researchers are encouraged to document data appropriately, (see our guidance on data documentation and metadata), to include research procedures and fieldwork methods and to ensure that data are held in organised manner. documentation is invaluable in enabling secondary users to contextualise data and conduct better informed re-use of material. any consent and confidentiality concerns which may inhibit archiving data should be resolved. see our guidance on consent and confidentiality. what are costs of preparing data and documentation for archiving? there should be no additional costs for archiving data, other than researcher(s) time to prepare data and documentation for deposit. this time should be costed into application. on average it is recommended that two to three weeks are costed into average two year research grant application to prepare and collate materials for deposit. however, owing to disparate nature of research and data creation, we cannot provide advice on exact costs likely to be incurred in data preparation. various activities typically associated with preparing data are outlined below, for which you can work out appropriate costs in terms of people's time and equipment/software needed. much data preparation can be carried out as part of research process during data entry and transcription, therefore significantly reducing cost of preparing data for archiving. for quantitative/numerical data, allow time to add appropriate variable, value and code labelling to data, to create spss set up files (if relevant), to supply syntax or logical statements for derived variables etc. as part of data-level documentation. for qualitative data, provision should be made for full transcription of interviews, focus groups discussions and so on, where budget will allow. transcription cost should be included in overall research budget. if full transcription is really not feasible, interviews or focus groups should be fully summarised. for transcript in non-english languages, english summaries should be prepared for archiving, so costs for translation might be appropriate. data listing giving details of each interview should be created. consent and data confidentiality also impact on costs for archiving. consent for data archiving should be arranged during research when consent for participation and data use is obtained, or arranged afterwards. allow time to anonymise data, where required. ideally anonymisation should be undertaken during project but will need to be checked before archiving data. time involved should not be underestimated as anonymisation appropriate for archiving may require use of pseudonyms, or preparation of anonymisation key. anonymised document should be meaningful and usable by other researchers. see anonymising research data guidelines and techniques for detailed guidance. cost of digitisation of non-digital sources, e.g. if research involves work on paper-based collection, can usually be included in overall research budget. additional suggestions and requirements on preparing data and documentation for archiving can be found in 'create and manage' pages. how can other researchers understand and therefore use my data? data can only be understood and used to their full potential by other researchers if they are adequately documented, see documenting your data. any potential re-user should understand exactly how research was carried out and what data mean. data creator should provide sufficient information on objectives and methodology of research; explain data collection methods used; explicitly describe meanings of variables and codes used and any derivation, transformations or data cleaning carried out. must i transcribe interviews if i want to archive them? it is recommended that transcriptions of interviews are made. full transcriptions significantly extend potential for analysis and re-use of research collection, both by original researchers and by secondary users. transcription should be seen as step within analytical process of research, rather than as mechanical conversion of data. if interviews are not transcribed, then recorded interviews could be archived alongside summaries. see guidance on transcription. how do i transcribe interviews? audio-visually recorded interviews are usually transcribed manually, see guidance on transcription. standard transcription structure is recommended if transcripts are to be archived or if computer assisted qualitative data analysis (caqdas) software is to be used to analyse data. transcriptions possess unique identifier, adopt uniform layout, make use of speaker tags clearly indicating question/answer sequence, carry line breaks, be page numbered and carry document header giving brief details of interview: date, place, interviewer name, interviewee details, etc. who do i contact if i need further advice on preparing data for archiving?

[ 'data management and sharing activities need to be costed into research, in terms of time and resources needed. by planning early, costs can be significantly reduced. there are two approaches to costing research data management and sharing in advance of research project starting. either can be used in data management plan or can inform funding application. approach 1: all data-related activities and resources for entire data lifecycle - from data creation, through processing, analyses and storage, to sharing and long-term preservation - can be priced to calculate total cost of all data generation, data sharing, data access and preservation activities. approach 2: only resources that would be needed to preserve and make research data shareable beyond primary research team are identified. these resources may include: people, equipment, infrastructure and tools to manage, document, organise, store and provide access to data. data management costing tool there is no hard and fast rule for costing research data management, as some projects will afford more attention to detailed data documentation, organisation and formatting than others as part of routine fieldwork or data preparation before analysis. however, uk data service has developed simple activity-based costing tool that can be used for approach 2 of costing data management in social sciences. how costing tool was developed data management costing tool was developed with researchers as part of jisc data management planning for esrc research data-rich investments project, through data management interviews with researchers in esrc centres and programmes. researchers were asked to estimate time or cost needed for activities related to data collection, data entry and transcription, data validation and documentation and cost of preparing data for archiving and re-use. overall, researchers found it hard to cost data management activities, as many activities are integral part of standard research activities and data analysis. identified high cost activities were transcribing and anonymising qualitative data and cleaning and verifying quantitative data. information from researchers was then combined with our expertise in measures needed to make research data shareable and reusable. key is that when preparing data for sharing is left until end of project, cost is often too high due to competition with publishing and seeking future project funding.']

[ "data security is relevant to protect intellectual property rights, commercial interests, or to keep sensitive information safe. arrangements need to be proportionate to nature of data and risks involved. data that contain personal information should be treated with higher levels of security than data which do not, as safeguarding of personal data is dictated by national legislation, data protection act 1998, which states that personal data should only be accessible to authorised persons. personal data can be stored in digital files, or can exist in non-digital format: patient records, signed consent forms, interview cover sheets containing names, addresses and signatures. security can be made easier by: separating data content according to security needs, e.g. store participant names and addresses separately from survey files encrypting data containing personal information before they are stored or transmitted attention to security is also important when data files are to be destroyed. physical security controlling access to buildings, rooms, cabinets where data, computers, media or hardcopy materials are held logging removal of, and access to, media or hardcopy material in store rooms transporting sensitive data only under exceptional circumstances, even for repair purposes; for example, giving failed hard drive containing sensitive data to computer manufacturer may cause breach of security network security not storing sensitive data such as those containing personal information on servers or computers connected to external network, particularly servers that host internet services firewall protection and security-related upgrades and patches to operating systems to avoid viruses and malicious code security of computer systems and files locking computer systems with password ensuring computer software is up-to-date protecting servers by power surge protection systems through line-interactive uninterruptible power supply (ups) systems implementing password protection and controlled access to data files, for example \xe2\x80\x98no access', \xe2\x80\x98read only', \xe2\x80\x98read and write' or \xe2\x80\x98administrator-only' permission controlling access to files, folders or entire hard drives encryption not sending personal or confidential data via email or other file transfer means without first encrypting them destroying data in consistent manner when needed: deleting files and reformatting hard drive will not prevent possible recovery of data; consult our guidance on data disposal imposing non-disclosure agreements for managers or users of confidential data data security and cloud storage cloud-based storage such as google drive, dropbox, onedrive, icloud or yousendit are easy to use, but not necessarily permanent or secure. cloud-based storage is often based overseas and therefore not covered by uk law and could be in violation of uk data protection act 1998, which states that personal and sensitive data should not be transferred to other countries without adequate protection. cloud data storage should be avoided for high-risk information such as files that contain personal or sensitive information, information that is covered by law or that has very high intellectual property value. while file encryption can be used to safeguard data files to certain degree, it would still not meet requirements of data protection legislation. alternatives are secure ftp servers, content management systems set up and controlled by institution or secure workspaces. see our guidance on file sharing."]

[ "encryption is process of encoding digital information in such way that only authorised parties can view it. individual files can be encrypted, as can folders or entire disk volumes and usb storage devices. encryption software uses algorithm to encode information and decryption key or password to decrypt information. some types of encryption provide greater protection than others, type and level of encryption used should correspond to sensitivity of data being protected. as general rule, more bits equals stronger encryption, therefore, 256-bit encryption is stronger than 128-bit encryption; latter should, ideally, be minimum level of encryption used. in addition to securing data, encryption can also be used to verify sender's identity and integrity of data. commonly used encryption software includes: bitlocker - standard on selected editions of windows; for encryption of disk volumes and usb devices filevault2 - standard on apple macs; for full disc encryption veracrypt - multi-platform encryption software (windows, mac and linux); for full disk and container encryption axcrypt - open source file-level encryption for windows safehouse - free and commercial software versions available for windows. encrypts files, folders and drives we have created video tutorials on how to use variety of encryption software programmes. these are available from quick access menu on right side of page. pgp - pretty good privacy can encrypt anything from file to entire disk volume and is widely recognised as most ubiquitous encryption software commonly available. open source versions (gpg4win) and commercial versions (pgp) are available, latter having more functionality, but identical levels of security. encryption of data files when exchanging data with uk data service for secure data transmission to and from uk data service we recommend use of pgp. encryption using pgp requires creation of public and private key pair and passphrase. recipient's public pgp key is installed by sender in order to encrypt files so that only authorised recipient can decrypt them. senders private pgp key and passphrase are used to digitally sign encrypted file, thereby validating sender's identity. steps to encrypt data files for deposit with uk data service, using pgp once: install pgp encryption software, for example gnupg create your own public/private key pair and passphrase download uk data service public key and unzip it import uk data service public key into your pgp software's keychain every time files need encrypting: select files for encryption select uk data service public key as your encryption key confirm your pgp signing key and enter your passphrase encrypt and digitally sign selected files send files to uk data service using our secure sftp server or royal mail special delivery"]

[ "about uk data archive what are data archives? data archives are resource centres for analysts who use data for research and teaching. their functions usually include: ensuring that data are preserved against technological obsolescence and physical damage checking, validating and preparing data and accompanying user documentation cataloguing their technical and substantive properties for information and retrieval supplying them in appropriate form to secondary users supporting users in using data social science data archiving movement began in 1960s within number of key social science departments in united states who stored original coded interview data deriving from academic surveys. movement spread across europe and in 1967 uk data archive ( archive) was established by uk social science research council (now economic and social research council (esrc)). in late 1970s many national archives joined wider professional organisations to foster co-operation on key archival strategies, procedures and technologies; encourage exchange of data and technology across national boundaries; and promote acquisition, archiving and distribution of electronic data for social science teaching and research. what services does uk data archive provide? uk data archive is curator of largest collection of digital data in social sciences and humanities in united kingdom. with several thousand datasets relating to society, both historical and contemporary, our archive is vital resource for researchers, teachers and learners. we acquire high quality data from academic, public, and commercial sectors, providing continuous access to these data while we also support existing and emerging and communities of data users. we are acknowledged centre of expertise in areas of acquiring, curating and providing access to data. since 2005 our archive has been designated place of deposit by national archives allowing us to curate public records. we direct and manage uk data service which is uk's flagship portal for research resources, where we host key national and international survey data, databanks, census data and and qualitative data. more recently we have been providing secure access to disclosive and more sensitive data. we have been engaged in number of data management initiatives supported by esrc and jisc including running rural economy and land use programme (relu) data support service which focused on providing access to key environmental data. we also provide curation of data for other organisations at cost. we are proud to be actively engaged in research and development, and throughout our 40+ year history, we have remained at cutting edge to become international leader in curating and sharing data. where do your data come from? data collections are deposited from variety of sources, including academic researchers, government departments, intergovernmental organisations, independent research institutes, and market research organisations. academic research funded by economic and social research council (esrc) is important source of data, as council operates mandatory datasets policy whereby all award holders are expected to offer data to uk data archive for archiving. examples of large-scale esrc datasets are british social attitudes survey (bsas), british election studies (bes) and british household panel study (bhps). censuses and large surveys carried out by governments for their own policy purposes are particularly rich sources of data for further exploration. central government, and in particular, office for national statistics (ons) is major and regular supplier of data series, including general household survey (ghs), labour force survey (lfs), and health survey for england (hse). some data collections may not have been collected specifically for research purposes. administrative databases, such as national health service patient re-registrations, although collected for very different purpose, can provide valuable and timely information for researchers. what is uk data service? uk data service provides unified point of access to extensive range of high quality social and economic data, including census data, government funded surveys, longitudinal studies, international macrodata, qualitative data and business microdata. it is designed to provide seamless access and support to meet current and future research demands of both academic and non-academic users, and to help them maximise impact of their work. uk data service is new service which replaces earlier esrc investments of economic and social data service (esds), secure data service (sds), survey question bank and elements of esrc census programme. it also incorporates outputs from cross-council relu data support service (relu-dss). what happened to relu data support service? rural economy and land use programme data support service (relu-dss) was dedicated support service funded by esrc, nerc ad bbsrc to provide information and guidance to researchers and project managers from programme on data management, data sharing and preservation. outputs from portal are available. what happened to esds, sds and sqb? economic and social data service (esds) is now integrated into uk data service, along with former secure data service (sds), survey question bank (sqb), elements of esrc census programme and outputs friom relu data support service. what services do you provide for guidance on research data management? research data management support services team at uk data archive is actively involved in developing knowledge, guidance and capacity building in managing and sharing data, primarily for social sciences. our up-to-date guidance can be found on uk data service website, together with links to our book published in 2014 by sage publications. we run training events on various aspects of managing and sharing research data. our team undertakes range of r&d projects on research data management support and training for researchers and research centres, through grants from esrc, jisc and eu."]

==============================================
[ "informing participants as part of informed consent procedures, it is important to tell participants about purpose and benefits of sharing and archiving research data and making them available for future research, so participant can take informed decision. following information can be used to explain this, with appropriate modifications for your research. what is data archive? data archive is secure place where different types of materials are stored and looked after indefinitely. most traditional archives deal with paper records, such as local history archive. in digital age many archives now hold electronic records. these demand different methods and skills to curate materials to ensure that they can be used well into future. uk data archive houses several thousand datasets of interest to researchers, teachers and students who work in social sciences or humanities, and makes this material available for use in research and learning. why put data in archive?for many participants of research study, taking part is way of getting their voices heard and of being listened to. sharing their lives and stories in in-depth interview is way for them to have say about topics that are important to them. some people are happy to have their own names attributed to material they provide, while others prefer not to. either way, providing 'voice' is essential job for archive. second reason to put materials in archive is that it is impossible for researchers to learn everything they want to from data they collect at time of their project. because so many things can be learned from data, preserving them means they can be shared with other researchers who will find data useful now and for many years to come. another important reason to archive data is that some of data have been provided by very hard-to-reach groups, politicians, sick, very elderly, socially excluded or those who otherwise are not usually included in research projects. it is often very difficult and expensive to recruit such participants for research and, once they have contributed, it is important to make full use of information they have given. lastly, archives are very good places to keep data safe and secure, providing lasting evidence of published research findings. archivists are experts in backing up data, protecting them from viruses and more. they also specialise in looking after data to make sure they can still be used many years in future when technology will be very different from today. how do i know my data will be used ethically?putting data into archive is not same as making them available on web. archivists value materials deposited with them and take their duty very seriously to make sure materials are used only in appropriate ways. their primary concern is to protect research participants. to that end, there are three strategies for protecting data. first is to gain informed consent from participants to share data; second is to anonymise data; and third is to control access to data, via licensing. in almost every archive, some data will be available to public, some will be covered by standard licence, some need special permission, and some data are made unavailable for lengthy period. what does anonymising mean?this means removing anything that could identify participant or anyone talked about in data. good examples are names of people and places. in archives, personal contact details are never made available. examples would include things such as addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses. here is example of anonymising some real names: original textanonymised text schools e.g. st john's primary schoollocal secondary school or chosen made up name businesses e.g. mcdonald'sfast food outlet/restaurant or chosen made up name family and friends' names e.g. auntie bettychanged to aunt or pseudonym how might data be used?data can be used in many ways. for example, one well-known collection known as edwardians, which interviewed 450 older people born before 1918, has been used to study topics as different as men's roles in family meal preparation, and how young civilian soldiers survived trench warfare on western front by drawing on emotional and practical support of their families. archived data may also be used by researchers, to compare with their own materials; by teachers, for use in their courses; and by journalists and policymakers. others may be interested in how research was done, e.g. how questions were asked. of course, it is almost impossible to predict all ways that data might be used. past examples have shown that users are very creative in looking at data in very new and innovative ways. who owns data and what is copyright?if you are asked to sign copyright statement this means that person asking will have legal right to use your contributions on agreed terms. for example, they can publish article on research which may quote some of your words. researcher can further sign licence with archive that allows archive to legally distribute material to bona fide researchers, under conditions agreed by researcher. how do archives store my data safely?in many archives, data are stored in conditions that meet national and international standards - temperature, security and so on. they will have licences and access controls to ensure that only authorised and registered users can get hold of data. because sharing your data can be done safely and because there are so many benefits, we hope you will agree to archive your data."]
==============================================
[ "overview in order to make sure that research data can be made available for future reuse, it is important that consent for future reuse of data by other researchers is sought from participants. participants should be informed how research data will be stored, preserved and used in long-term, and how confidentiality can be protected when needed. language to avoidconsent forms should not preclude data sharing. so promises to destroy data or promises that data will only be seen or accessed by research team should be avoided. terms such as 'fully anonymous' or 'strictly confidential' should be avoided, as they are often impossible to define. better is to indicate how data will be anonymised (e.g. by removing all personal information that could directly identify individual) and that whilst data will be made available to other researchers, confidentiality will be protected. how to seek consent for data sharingconsent procedures must be tailored for specific research context, methods and sample, nature of data (personal, sensitive, level of detail), format of data (surveys, written, recordings) and planned data uses and handling. this will influence type of consent and consent process used. more detailed requirements and examples of these are offered in sections on gaining written or oral consent, and consent forms. it is important to note that researchers are not obliged to obtain consent. they are obliged to seek consent and to impartially advise participants about risks and benefits of research participation and data sharing. participants then decide what they will consent to."]
